	* tclScan.c: moved "scan" implementation out of tclCmdMZ.c and
	added Unicode support.  This required a complete reimplementation
	of the command to avoid using scanf(), which isn't Unicode aware.
	Two new features were added in the process: %n to return the
	current number of characters consumed, and XPG3-style %n$ argument
	order specifiers similar to those provided by the "format"
	command. [Bug: 833]

	* tclAlloc.c: changed so allocated memory is always 8-byte aligned
	to improve memory performance and to ensure that it will work on
	systems that don't like accessing 4-byte aligned values
	(e.g. Solaris and HP-UX). [Bug: 834]

	* tclVar.c (TclGetIndexedScalar): Fixed bug 796, var name was
	getting lost before being passed to CallTraces.

	* added "encoding" command
	
	* Moved internal regexp declarations from tclInt.h to tclRegexp.h

	* integrated regexp updates from Henry Spencer

1998-10-15    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tclUtf.c: added Unicode character table support

	* tclInt.h: added TclUniCharIsWordChar

	* tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): added "totitle" subcommand,
	changed "wordend" and "wordstart" to properly handle Unicode word
	characters and connector punctuation

1998-10-05    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): changed to avoid modifying the
	input string in place because name lookup operations could have
	arbitrary side effects

	* tclInterp.c: added guard against deleting current interpreter

	* tclFileName.c: added warnings around code that modifies strings
	in place

	* tclExecute.c: fixed off-by-one copying error, fixed merge bugs

	* tclEvent.c: changed so USE_TCLALLOC is tested for value instead
	of definition

	* tclCompCmds.c: replaced SCCS strings, added warnings around code
	that modifies strings in place
