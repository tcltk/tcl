 * the channel. We cannot construct the command to execute and forward that.
 * Because then it will contain a mixture of Tcl_Obj's belonging to both the
 * command handler thread (CT), and the thread managing the channel (MT),
 * executed in CT. Tcl_Obj's are not allowed to cross thread boundaries. So we
 * forward an operation code, the argument details, and reference to results.
 * The command is assembled in the CT and belongs fully to that thread. No
 * sharing problems.
