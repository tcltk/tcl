 *  it may be stored in an encoding form such as a modified version of UTF-8
 *  or UTF-16 (when TCL_UTF_MAX=3) or UTF-32.

 * The following structure is the internal rep for a String object. It keeps
 * track of how much memory has been used and how much has been allocated for
 * the various representations to enable growing and shrinking of
 * the String object with fewer mallocs. To optimize string
 * length and indexing operations, this structure also stores the number of
 * code points (independent of encoding form) once that value has been computed.
