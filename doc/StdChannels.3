.SH NAME
Tcl_StandardChannels \- How the Tcl library deals with the standard channels
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This page explains the initialization and use of standard channels in
the Tcl library.
.PP
The term \fIstandard channels\fR comes out of the Unix world and
refers to the three channels automatically opened by the OS for
each new application. They are \fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR and
\fBstderr\fR. The first is the standard input an application can read
from, the other two refer to writable channels, one for regular
output and the other for error messages.
.PP
Tcl generalizes this concept in a cross-platform way and
exposes standard channels to the script level.
.SH APIs
.PP
The public API procedures dealing directly with standard channels are
\fBTcl_GetStdChannel\fR and \fBTcl_SetStdChannel\fR. Additional public
APIs to consider are \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR,
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR and \fBTcl_GetChannel\fR.
.SH Initialization of Tcl standard channels
.PP
There are several ways for the Tcl standard channels to be
initialized, described below. Each of these deals differently with the
situation of having no platform-specific standard channels available.
A channel is not "available" if it could not be successfully opened;
for example, in a Tcl application run as a Windows NT service.
.TP
1)
The application using the Tcl library explicitly specifies the Tcl
channels to use as standard channels by calling
\fBTcl_SetStdChannel\fR.  Missing platform-specific standard channels
do not matter here. This approach is not available at the script
level.
.TP
2a)
The application asks for one of the Tcl standard channels by calling
\fBTcl_GetStdChannel\fR. This will initialize any of them which were
not initialized before to their platform-dependent default values.
.sp
In case of missing platform-specific standard channels, the Tcl
standard channels are considered as initialized and then immediately
closed. This means that the first three Tcl channels then opened by
the application are designated as the Tcl standard channels.
.TP
2b)
This is a special case of (2a). The initialization mentioned there
will also happen whenever \fBTcl_GetChannel\fR is called with one of
the standard names \fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR and \fBstderr\fR as the
name of the channel to retrieve. This happens whenever a command
expecting a channel handle gets one of the standard names as its
argument.
.TP
2c)
Introspection of the list of open channels via \fBfile channels\fR (or
\fBTcl_GetChannelNames\fR) will also initialize the Tcl standard
channels to their platform-dependent default values.
.TP
3)
If the application does neither of the above the Tcl library will
setup and initialize the Tcl standard channels to their platform
dependent default values during the creation of the first
user-requested channel. This happens inside of
\fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR.
.sp
In case of missing platform-specific standard channels the channel
whose creation caused the initialization of the Tcl standard channels
is made a normal channel. The next three Tcl channels opened by the
application are designated as the Tcl standard channels. In other
words, of the first four Tcl channels opened by the application the
second to fourth are designated as the Tcl standard channels.

.PP
.SH Re-initialization of Tcl standard channels
.PP
Once a Tcl standard channel is initialized through one of the methods
above, closing this Tcl standard channel will cause the next call to
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR to make the new channel the new standard
channel, too. If more than one Tcl standard channel was closed
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR will fill the empty slots in the order
\fBstdin\fR, \fBstdout\fR and \fBstderr\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR will not try to reinitialize an empty slot if
that slot was not initialized before. It is this behavior which
enables an application to employ method 1 of initialization, i.e. to
create and designate their own Tcl standard channels.

.SH tclsh
.PP
The Tcl shell (or rather \fBTcl_Main\fR) uses method 2 to initialize
the standard channels.

.SH wish
.PP
The windowing shell (or rather \fBTk_MainEx\fR) uses method 1 to
initialize the standard channels (See \fBTk_InitConsoleChannels\fR)
on non-Unix platforms.  On Unix platforms, \fBTk_MainEx\fR implicitly
uses method 2 to initialize the standard channels.
