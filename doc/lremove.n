.SH NAME
lremove \- Remove elements from a list by index
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlremove \fIlist\fR ?\fIindex ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlremove\fR returns a new list formed by simultaneously removing zero or
more elements of \fIlist\fR at each of the indices given by an arbirary number
of \fIindex\fR arguments. The indices may be in any order and may be repeated;
the element at index will only be removed once.  The index values are
interpreted the same as index values for the command \fBstring index\fR,
supporting simple index arithmetic and indices relative to the end of the
list.  0 refers to the first element of the list, and \fBend\fR refers to the
last element of the list.
.SH EXAMPLES

a b d e
.CE
