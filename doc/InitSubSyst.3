.TH Tcl_InitSubsystems 3 8.7 Tcl "Tcl Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tcl_InitSubsystems \- initialize the Tcl library.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
void
\fBTcl_InitSubsystems\fR(\fIvoid\fR)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBTcl_InitSubsystems\fR procedure initializes the Tcl
library. This procedure is typically invoked as the very
first thing in the application's main program.
.PP
\fBTcl_InitSubsystems\fR is very similar in use to
\fBTcl_FindExecutable\fR. It can be used when Tcl is
used as utility library, no other encodings than utf8,
iso8859-1 or unicode are used, and no interest exists in the
value of \fBinfo nameofexecutable\fR. The system encoding will not
be extracted from the environment, but falls back to iso8859-1.
.SH KEYWORDS
binary, executable file
