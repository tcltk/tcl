Pointer to an array of strings containing the command
line arguments to main()
.AS Tcl_Interp **termPtr

Name of a mount point.
.AP "const char" *passwd in
An (optional) password.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBTclZipfs_AppHook()\fR is a utility function to perform standard
application initialization procedures. If the current application has
a mountable zip file system, that file system is mounted under \fIZIPROOT\fR\fB/app\fR.
If a file named \fBmain.tcl\fR is located in that file system, it is treated
as the startup script for the process. If the file \fIZIPROOT\fR\fB/app/tcl_library/init.tcl\fR
is present, \fBtcl_library\fR is set to  \fIZIPROOT\fR\fB/app/tcl_library.
.PP
If the \fBtcl_library\fR was not found in the application, the system will then search for it
as either a VFS attached to the application dynamic library, or as a zip archive named
libtcl_\fIMAJOR\fR_\fIMINOR\fR_\fIpatchLevel\fR.zip either in the present working directory
or in the standard tcl install location.
.PP
\fBTclzipfs_Mount()\fR mount the ZIP archive \fIzipname\fR on the mount
point given in \fImntpt\fR using the optional ZIP password \fIpasswd\fR.
Errors during that process are reported in the interpreter \fIinterp\fR.
If \fIzipname\fR is a NULL pointer, information on all currently mounted
ZIP file systems is written into \fIinterp\fR's result as a sequence of
mount points and ZIP file names.
.PP
\fBTclzipfs_Unmount()\fR undoes the effect of \fBTclzipfs_Mount()\fR,
i.e. it unmounts the mounted ZIP archive file \fIzipname\fR. Errors are
reported in the interpreter \fIinterp\fR.
