.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBzipfs\fR package provides tcl with the ability to mount
the contents of a zip file as a virtual file system.
.TP
\fB::zipfs::exists\fR \fIfilename\fR
.
Return 1 if the given filename exists in the mounted zipfs and 0 if it does not.
.TP
\fB::zipfs::find\fR \fIdir\fR
.
Recursively lists files including and below the directory \fIdir\fR.
The result list consists of relative path names starting from the
given directory. This command is also used by the \fB::zipfs::mkzip\fR
and \fB::zipfs::mkimg\fR commands.
.TP
\fB::zipfs::info\fR \fIfile\fR
.
Return information about the given file in the mounted zipfs.  The information
consists of (1) the name of the ZIP archive file that contains the file,
(2) the size of the file after decompressions, (3) the compressed size of
the file, and (4) the offset of the compressed data in the ZIP archive file.
.RS
.PP
Note: querying the mount point gives the start of zip data offset in (4),
which can be used to truncate the zip info off an executable.
.RE
.TP
\fB::zipfs::list\fR \fB?(-glob|-regexp)?\fR \fI?pattern?\fR
.
Return a list of all files in the mounted zipfs.  The order of the names
in the list is arbitrary.
.TP
\fB::zipfs::mkimg\fR \fIoutfile\fR \fIindir\fR \fI?strip?\fR \fI?password?\fR \fI?infile?\fR
.
Creates an image (potentially a new executable file) similar to
\fB::zipfs::mkzip\fR. If the \fIinfile\fR parameter is specified,
this file is prepended in front of the ZIP archive, otherwise the file
returned by \fBTcl_NameOfExecutable(3)\fR (i.e. the executable file of
the running process) is used. If the \fIpassword\fR parameter is not empty,
an obfuscated version of that password is placed between the image and ZIP
chunks of the output file and the contents of the ZIP chunk are protected
with that password.
.RS
.PP
Caution: highly experimental, not usable on Android, only partially tested
on Linux and Windows.
.RE
.TP
\fB::zipfs::mkkey\fR \fIpassword\fR
.
For the clear text \fIpassword\fR argument an obfuscated string version
is returned with the same format used in the \fB::zipfs::mkimg\fR command.
.TP
\fB::zipfs::mkzip\fR \fIoutfile\fR \fIindir\fR \fI?strip?\fR \fI?password?\fR
.
Creates a ZIP archive file named \fIoutfile\fR from the contents of the input
directory \fIindir\fR (contained regular files only) with optional ZIP
password \fIpassword\fR. While processing the files below \fIindir\fR the
optional file name prefix given in \fIstrip\fR is stripped off the beginning
of the respective file name.
.RS
.PP
Caution: the choice of the \fIindir\fR parameter
(less the optional stripped prefix) determines the later root name of the
archive's content.
.RE
.TP
\fB::zipfs::mount ?\fIzipfile\fR? ?\fImountpoint\fR?
.
The \fB::zipfs::mount\fR command mounts a ZIP archive file as a VFS.
After this command executes, files contained in \fIzipfile\fR
will appear to Tcl to be regular files at the mount point.
.RS
.PP
With no \fImountpoint\fR, returns the mount point for \fIzipfile\fR.
With no \fIzipfile\fR, return all zipfile/mount pairs.
If \fImountpoint\fR is specified as an empty string, mount on file path.
.RE
.TP
\fB::zipfs::unmount \fIzipfile\fR
.
Unmounts a previously mounted ZIP archive file \fIzipfile\fR.
