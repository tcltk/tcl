.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBzipfs\fR command provides Tcl with the ability to mount the
contents of a ZIP archive file as a virtual file system. Tcl's ZIP
archive support is limited to basic features and options.
Supported storage methods include only STORE and DEFLATE with optional
simple encryption, sufficient to prevent casual inspection of their contents
but not able to prevent access by even a moderately determined attacker.
Strong encryption, multi-part archives, platform metadata,
zip64 formats and other compression methods like bzip2 are not supported.
.PP
Files within mounted archives can be written to but new files or directories
cannot be created. Further, modifications to files are limited to the
mounted archive in memory and are not persisted to disk.
.PP
Paths in mounted archives are case-sensitive on all platforms.
.\" METHOD: canonical
.TP
\fBzipfs canonical\fR ?\fImountpoint\fR? \fIfilename\fR
.
This takes the name of a file, \fIfilename\fR, and produces where it would be
mapped into a zipfs mount as its result. If specified, \fImountpoint\fR says
within which mount the mapping will be done; if omitted, the main root of the
zipfs system is used.
.\" METHOD: exists
.TP
\fBzipfs exists\fI filename\fR
.
Return 1 if the given filename exists in the mounted zipfs and 0 if it does not.
.\" METHOD: find
.TP
\fBzipfs find\fI directoryName\fR
.
Returns the list of paths under directory \fIdirectoryName\fR which need not be
within a zipfs mounted archive. The paths are prefixed with \fIdirectoryName\fR.
This command is also used by the \fBzipfs mkzip\fR and \fBzipfs mkimg\fR
commands.
.\" METHOD: info
.TP
\fBzipfs info\fI file\fR
.
Return information about the given \fIfile\fR in the mounted zipfs.  The
information consists of:
.RS
.IP (1)
the name of the ZIP archive file that contains the file,
.IP (2)
the size of the file after decompressions,
.IP (3)
the compressed size of the file, and
.IP (4)
the offset of the compressed data in the ZIP archive file.
.PP
As a special case, querying the mount point gives the start of the zip data
as the offset in (4), which can be used to truncate the zip information from
an executable. Querying an ancestor of a mount point will raise an error.
.RE
.\" METHOD: list
.TP
\fBzipfs list\fR ?\fImatchingType\fR? ?\fIpattern\fR?
.
If \fIpattern\fR is not specified, the command returns a list of files across
all zipfs mounted archives. If \fIpattern\fR is specified, only those paths
matching the pattern are returned. By default, or with \fImatchingType\fR
specified as \fB\-glob\fR, the pattern is treated as a glob pattern and
matching is done as described for the \fBstring match\fR command. Alternatively,
the \fImatchingType\fR \fB\-regexp\fR may be used to specify a matching
\fBpattern\fR as a regular expression. The file names
are returned in arbitrary order. Note that path separators are treated as
ordinary characters in the matching. Thus forward slashes should be used
as path separators in the pattern. The returned paths only include those
actually in the archive and does not include intermediate directories in
mount paths.
.\" METHOD: mount
.TP
\fBzipfs mount\fR
.TP
\fBzipfs mount\fI mountpoint\fR
.TP
\fBzipfs mount\fI zipfile mountpoint\fR ?\fIpassword\fR?
.RS
.PP
The \fBzipfs mount\fR command mounts ZIP archives as Tcl virtual file systems
and returns information about current mounts.
.PP
With no arguments, the command returns a dictionary mapping
mount points to the path of the corresponding ZIP archive.
.PP
In the single argument form, the command returns the file path
of the ZIP archive mounted at the specified mount point.
.PP
In the third form, the command mounts the ZIP archive \fIzipfile\fR as a Tcl
virtual filesystem at \fImountpoint\fR.  After this command executes, files
contained in \fIzipfile\fR will appear to Tcl to be regular files at the
mount point. If \fImountpoint\fR is
specified as an empty string, it is defaulted to the \fB[zipfs root]\fR.
The command returns the normalized mount point path.
.PP
If not under the zipfs file system root, \fImountpoint\fR is normalized with
respect to it. For example, a mount point passed as either \fBmt\fR or \fB/mt\fR
would be normalized to \fB//zipfs:/mt\fR (given that \fBzipfs root\fR
returns
.QW //zipfs:/ ).
An error is raised if the mount point includes a drive or UNC volume.
.PP
\fBNB:\fR because the current working directory is a concept maintained by the
operating system, using \fBcd\fR into a mounted archive will only work in the
current process, and then not entirely consistently (e.g., if a shared library
uses direct access to the OS rather than through Tcl's filesystem API, it will
not see the current directory as being inside the mount and will not be able
to access the files inside the mount).
.RE
.\" METHOD: mountdata
.TP
\fBzipfs mountdata\fR \fIdata\fR \fImountpoint\fR
Mounts the ZIP archive content \fIdata\fR as a Tcl virtual filesystem at
\fImountpoint\fR.
.\" METHOD: root
.TP
\fBzipfs root\fR
.
Returns a constant string which indicates the mount point for zipfs volumes
for the current platform. User should not rely on the mount point being
the same constant string for all platforms.
.\" METHOD: unmount
.TP
\fBzipfs unmount \fImountpoint\fR
.
Unmounts a previously mounted ZIP archive mounted to \fImountpoint\fR.
The command will fail with an error exception if
there are any files within the mounted archive are open.
.SS "ZIP CREATION COMMANDS"
This package also provides several commands to aid the creation of ZIP
archives as Tcl applications.
.\" METHOD: mkzip
.TP
\fBzipfs mkzip\fI outfile indir\fR ?\fIstrip\fR? ?\fIpassword\fR?
.
Creates a ZIP archive file named \fIoutfile\fR from the contents of the input
directory \fIindir\fR (contained regular files only) with optional ZIP
password \fIpassword\fR. While processing the files below \fIindir\fR the
optional file name prefix given in \fIstrip\fR is stripped off the beginning
of the respective file name if non-empty.  When stripping, it is common to remove either
the whole source directory name or the name of its parent directory.
.RS
.PP
\fBCaution:\fR the choice of the \fIindir\fR parameter (less the optional
stripped prefix) determines the later root name of the archive's content.
.RE
.\" METHOD: mkimg
.TP
\fBzipfs mkimg\fI outfile indir\fR ?\fIstrip\fR? ?\fIpassword\fR? ?\fIinfile\fR?
.
Creates an image (potentially a new executable file) similar to \fBzipfs
mkzip\fR; see that command for a description of most parameters to this
command, as they behave identically here. If \fIoutfile\fR exists, it will
be silently overwritten.
.RS
.PP
If the \fIinfile\fR parameter is specified, this file is prepended in front of
the ZIP archive, otherwise the file returned by \fBinfo nameofexecutable\fR
(i.e., the executable file of the running process,
typically \fBwish\fR or \fBtclsh\fR) is used. If the
\fIpassword\fR parameter is not the empty string, an obfuscated version of that password
(see \fBzipfs mkkey\fR) is placed between the image and ZIP chunks of the
output file and the contents of the ZIP chunk are protected with that
password.
If the starting image has a ZIP archive already attached to it, it is removed
from the copy in \fIoutfile\fR before the new ZIP archive is added.
.PP
If there is a file, \fBmain.tcl\fR, in the root directory of the resulting
archive and the image file that the archive is attached to is a \fBtclsh\fR
(or \fBwish\fR) instance (true by default, but depends on your configuration),
then the resulting image is an executable that will \fBsource\fR the script in
that \fBmain.tcl\fR after mounting the ZIP archive, and will \fBexit\fR once
that script has been executed.
.PP
\fBNote:\fR \fBtclsh\fR and \fBwish\fR can be built using either
dynamic binding or static binding of the core implementation
libraries. With a dynamic binding, the base application Tcl_Library
contents are attached to the \fBlibtcl\fR and \fBlibtk\fR shared
library, respectively. With a static binding, the Tcl_Library
contents, etc., are attached to the application, \fBtclsh\fR or
\fBwish\fR. When using \fBmkimg\fR with a statically built tclsh, it is
the user's responsibility to preserve the attached archive by first
extracting it to a temporary location, and then add whatever
additional files desired, before creating and attaching the new
archive to the new application.
.RE
.\" METHOD: mkkey
.TP
\fBzipfs mkkey\fI password\fR
.
Given the clear text \fIpassword\fR argument, an obfuscated string version is
returned with the same format used in the \fBzipfs mkimg\fR command.
.\" METHOD: lmkimg
.TP
\fBzipfs lmkimg\fI outfile inlist\fR ?\fIpassword\fR? ?\fIinfile\fR?
.
This command is like \fBzipfs mkimg\fR, but instead of an input directory,
\fIinlist\fR must be a Tcl list where the odd elements are the names of files
to be copied into the archive in the image, and the even elements are their
respective names within that archive.
.\" METHOD: lmkzip
.TP
\fBzipfs lmkzip\fI outfile inlist\fR ?\fIpassword\fR?
.
This command is like \fBzipfs mkzip\fR, but instead of an input directory,
\fIinlist\fR must be a Tcl list where the odd elements are the names of files
to be copied into the archive, and the even elements are their respective
names within that archive.
.SH "NOTE"
.PP
The current syntax for certain subcommands using multiple optional parameters might
change in the future to support an \fI?-option value?\fR pattern instead.
Therfore, the current syntax should not be considered stable.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Mounting an ZIP archive as an application directory and running code out of it
before unmounting it again:
.PP
.CS
set zip myApp.zip
set base [file join [\fBzipfs root\fR] myApp]

\fBzipfs mount\fR $zip $base
# $base now has the contents of myApp.zip

source [file join $base app.tcl]
# use the contents, load libraries from it, etc...

\fBzipfs unmount\fR $base
.CE
.PP
Creating a ZIP archive, given that a directory exists containing the content
to put in the archive. Note that the source directory is given twice, in order
to strip the exterior directory name from each filename in the archive.
.PP
.CS
set sourceDirectory [file normalize myApp]
set targetZip myApp.zip

\fBzipfs mkzip\fR $targetZip $sourceDirectory $sourceDirectory
.CE
.PP
Encryption can be applied to ZIP archives by providing a password when
building the ZIP and when mounting it.
.PP
.CS
set zip myApp.zip
set sourceDir [file normalize myApp]
set password "hunter2"
set base [file join [\fBzipfs root\fR] myApp]

# Create with password
\fBzipfs mkzip\fR $targetZip $sourceDir $sourceDir $password

# Mount with password
\fBzipfs mount\fR $zip $base $password
.CE
.PP
The following example creates an executable application by appending a ZIP archive
to the tclsh file it was called from and storing the resulting executable in
the file
.QW myApp.bin .
When creating an executable image with a password, the password is placed
within the executable in a shrouded form so that the application can read
files inside the embedded ZIP archive yet casual inspection cannot read it.
.PP
.CS
set appDir [file normalize myApp]
set img "myApp.bin"
set password "hunter2"

# Create some simple content to define a basic application
file mkdir $appDir
set f [open $appDir/main.tcl w]
puts $f {
    puts "Hi. This is [info script]"
}
close $f

# Create the executable application
\fBzipfs mkimg\fR $img $appDir $appDir $password

# remove the now obsolete temporary appDir folder
file delete -force $appDir

# Launch the executable, printing its output to stdout
exec $img >@stdout
# prints the following line assuming [zipfs root] returns "//zipfs:/":
# \fIHi. This is //zipfs:/app/main.tcl\fR
