.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBoo::define\fR command is used to control the configuration of classes,
and the \fBoo::objdefine\fR command is used to control the configuration of
objects (including classes as instance objects), with the configuration being
applied to the entity named in the \fIclass\fR or the \fIobject\fR argument.
Configuring a class also updates the
configuration of all subclasses of the class and all objects that are
instances of that class or which mix it in (as modified by any per-instance
configuration). The way in which the configuration is done is controlled by
either the \fIdefScript\fR argument or by the \fIsubcommand\fR and following
\fIarg\fR arguments; when the second is present, it is exactly as if all the
arguments from \fIsubcommand\fR onwards are made into a list and that list is
used as the \fIdefScript\fR argument.
.PP
Note that the constructor for \fBoo::class\fR will call \fBoo::define\fR on
the script argument that it is provided. This is a convenient way to create
and define a class in one step.
.SH "CONFIGURING CLASSES"
.PP
The following commands are supported in the \fIdefScript\fR for
\fBoo::define\fR, each of which may also be used in the \fIsubcommand\fR form:
.TP
\fBclassmethod\fI name\fR ?\fIargList bodyScrip\fR?
.VS TIP478
This creates a class method, or (if \fIargList\fR and \fIbodyScript\fR are
omitted) promotes an existing method on the class object to be a class
method. The \fIname\fR, \fIargList\fR and \fIbodyScript\fR arguments are as in
the \fBmethod\fR definition, below.
.RS
.PP
Class methods can be called on either the class itself or on the instances of
that class. When they are called, the current object (see the \fBsel\fR and
\fBmy\fR commands) is the class on which they are called or the class of the
instance on which they are called, depending on whether they are called on the
class or an instance of the class, respectively. If called on a subclass or
instance of the subclass, the current object is the subclass.
.PP
In a private definition context, the methods as invoked on classes are
\fInot\fR private, but the methods as invoked on instances of classes are
private.
.RE
.VE TIP478
.TP
\fBconstructor\fI argList bodyScript\fR
.
This creates or updates the constructor for a class. The formal arguments to
the constructor (defined using the same format as for the Tcl \fBproc\fR
command) will be \fIargList\fR, and the body of the constructor will be
\fIbodyScript\fR. When the body of the constructor is evaluated, the current
namespace of the constructor will be a namespace that is unique to the object
being constructed. Within the constructor, the \fBnext\fR command should be
used to call the superclasses' constructors. If \fIbodyScript\fR is the empty
string, the constructor will be deleted.
.RS
.PP
Classes do not need to have a constructor defined. If none is specified, the
superclass's constructor will be used instead.
.RE
.TP
\fBdestructor\fI bodyScript\fR
.
This creates or updates the destructor for a class. Destructors take no
arguments, and the body of the destructor will be \fIbodyScript\fR. The
destructor is called when objects of the class are deleted, and when called
will have the object's unique namespace as the current namespace. Destructors
should use the \fBnext\fR command to call the superclasses' destructors. Note
that destructors are not called in all situations (e.g. if the interpreter is
destroyed). If \fIbodyScript\fR is the empty string, the destructor will be
deleted.
.RS
Note that errors during the evaluation of a destructor \fIare not returned\fR
to the code that causes the destruction of an object. Instead, they are passed
to the currently-defined \fBbgerror\fR handler.
.RE
.TP
\fBexport\fI name \fR?\fIname ...\fR?
.
This arranges for each of the named methods, \fIname\fR, to be exported
(i.e. usable outside an instance through the instance object's command) by the
class being defined. Note that the methods themselves may be actually defined
by a superclass; subclass exports override superclass visibility, and may in
turn be overridden by instances.
.TP
\fBforward\fI name cmdName \fR?\fIarg ...\fR?
.
This creates or updates a forwarded method called \fIname\fR. The method is
defined be forwarded to the command called \fIcmdName\fR, with additional
arguments, \fIarg\fR etc., added before those arguments specified by the
caller of the method. The \fIcmdName\fR will always be resolved using the
rules of the invoking objects' namespaces, i.e., when \fIcmdName\fR is not
fully-qualified, the command will be searched for in each object's namespace,
using the instances' namespace's path, or by looking in the global namespace.
The method will be exported if \fIname\fR starts with a lower-case letter, and
non-exported otherwise.
.RS

\fBinitialize\fI script\fR
.VS TIP478
This evaluates \fIscript\fR in a context which supports local variables and
where the current namespace is the instance namespace of the class object
itself. This is useful for setting up, e.g., class-scoped variables.
.VE TIP478
.TP
\fBmethod\fI name \fR?\fIoption\fR? \fIargList bodyScript\fR
.
This creates or updates a method that is implemented as a procedure-like
script. The name of the method is \fIname\fR, the formal arguments to the
method (defined using the same format as for the Tcl \fBproc\fR command) will
be \fIargList\fR, and the body of the method will be \fIbodyScript\fR. When
the body of the method is evaluated, the current namespace of the method will
be a namespace that is unique to the current object. The method will be
exported if \fIname\fR starts with a lower-case letter, and non-exported
otherwise; this behavior can be overridden via \fBexport\fR and
\fBunexport\fR
.VS  TIP519
or by specifying \fB\-export\fR, \fB\-private\fR or \fB\-unexport\fR in the
optional parameter \fIoption\fR.

.RS
.PP
.VS TIP500
If in a private definition context (see the \fBprivate\fR definition command,

creates private procedure-like methods.

\fBprivate \fIcmd arg...\fR
.TP
\fBprivate \fIscript\fR
.
.VS TIP500
This evaluates the \fIscript\fR (or the list of command and arguments given by
\fIcmd\fR and \fIarg\fRs) in a context where the definitions made on the
current class will be private definitions.
.RS
.PP
The following class definition commands are affected by \fBprivate\fR:
\fBforward\fR, \fBmethod\fR, \fBself\fR, and \fBvariable\fR. Nesting
\fBprivate\fR inside \fBprivate\fR has no cumulative effect; the innermost
definition context is just a private definition context. All other definition
commands have no difference in behavior when used in a private definition
context.
.RE
.VE TIP500
.TP
\fBself\fI subcommand arg ...\fR
.TP
\fBself\fI script\fR
.TP
\fBself\fR
.
This command is equivalent to calling \fBoo::objdefine\fR on the class being
defined (see \fBCONFIGURING OBJECTS\fR below for a description of the
supported values of \fIsubcommand\fR). It follows the same general pattern of
argument handling as the \fBoo::define\fR and \fBoo::objdefine\fR commands,
and
.QW "\fBoo::define \fIcls \fBself \fIsubcommand ...\fR"
operates identically to
.QW "\fBoo::objdefine \fIcls subcommand ...\fR" .
.RS
.PP
.VS TIP470
If no arguments at all are used, this gives the name of the class currently
being configured.
.VE TIP470
.VS TIP500
If in a private definition context (see the \fBprivate\fR definition command,
below), the definitions on the class object will also be made in a private
definition context.
.VE TIP500
.RE
.TP
\fBsuperclass\fR ?\fI\-slotOperation\fR? ?\fIclassName ...\fR?
.
This slot (see \fBSLOTTED DEFINITIONS\fR below)
allows the alteration of the superclasses of the class being defined.
Each \fIclassName\fR argument names one class that is to be a superclass of
the defined class. Note that objects must not be changed from being classes to
being non-classes or vice-versa, that an empty parent class is equivalent to
\fBoo::object\fR, and that the parent classes of \fBoo::object\fR and
\fBoo::class\fR may not be modified.
By default, this slot works by replacement.
.TP
\fBunexport\fI name \fR?\fIname ...\fR?
.
This arranges for each of the named methods, \fIname\fR, to be not exported
(i.e. not usable outside the instance through the instance object's command,
but instead just through the \fBmy\fR command visible in each object's
context) by the class being defined. Note that the methods themselves may be
actually defined by a superclass; subclass unexports override superclass
visibility, and may be overridden by instance unexports.
.TP
\fBvariable\fR ?\fI\-slotOperation\fR? ?\fIname ...\fR?
.
This slot (see \fBSLOTTED DEFINITIONS\fR below) arranges for each of the named
variables to be automatically made
available in the methods, constructor and destructor declared by the class
being defined. Each variable name must not have any namespace
separators and must not look like an array access. All variables will be
actually present in the namespace of the instance object on which the method
is executed. Note
that the variable lists declared by a superclass or subclass are completely
disjoint, as are variable lists declared by instances; the list of variable
names is just for methods (and constructors and destructors) declared by this
class. By default, this slot works by appending.
.RS
.PP
.VS TIP500
If in a private definition context (see the \fBprivate\fR definition command,
below), this slot manipulates the list of private variable bindings for this
class. In a private variable binding, the name of the variable within the
instance object is different to the name given in the definition; the name
used in the definition is the name that you use to access the variable within
the methods of this class, and the name of the variable in the instance
namespace has a unique prefix that makes accidental use from other classes
extremely unlikely.
.VE TIP500
.RE
.SS "ADVANCED CLASS CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
.PP
The following definitions are also supported, but are not required in simple
programs:
.TP
\fBdefinitionnamespace\fR ?\fIkind\fR? \fInamespaceName\fR
.VS TIP524
This allows control over what namespace will be used by the \fBoo::define\fR
and \fBoo::objdefine\fR commands to look up the definition commands they
use. When any object has a definition operation applied to it, \fIthe class that
it is an instance of\fR (and its superclasses and mixins) is consulted for
what definition namespace to use. \fBoo::define\fR gets the class definition
namespace, and \fB::oo::objdefine\fR gets the instance definition namespace,
but both otherwise use the identical lookup operation.
.RS
.PP
This sets the definition namespace of kind \fIkind\fR provided by the current
class to \fInamespaceName\fR. The \fInamespaceName\fR must refer to a
currently existing namespace, or must be the empty string (to stop the current
class from having such a namespace connected). The \fIkind\fR, if supplied,
must be either \fB\-class\fR (the default) or \fB\-instance\fR to specify the
whether the namespace for use with \fBoo::define\fR or \fBoo::objdefine\fR
respectively is being set.
.PP
The class \fBoo::object\fR has its instance namespace locked to
\fB::oo::objdefine\fR, and the class \fBoo::class\fR has its class namespace
locked to \fB::oo::define\fR. A consequence of this is that effective use of
this feature for classes requires the definition of a metaclass.
.RE
.VE TIP524
.TP
\fBdeletemethod\fI name\fR ?\fIname ...\fR?
.
This deletes each of the methods called \fIname\fR from a class. The methods
must have previously existed in that class. Does not affect the superclasses
of the class, nor does it affect the subclasses or instances of the class
(except when they have a call chain through the class being modified).
.TP
\fBfilter\fR ?\fI\-slotOperation\fR? ?\fImethodName ...\fR?
.
This slot (see \fBSLOTTED DEFINITIONS\fR below)
sets or updates the list of method names that are used to guard whether
method call to instances of the class may be called and what the method's
results are. Each \fImethodName\fR names a single filtering method (which may
be exposed or not exposed); it is not an error for a non-existent method to be
named since they may be defined by subclasses.
By default, this slot works by appending.
.TP
\fBmixin\fR ?\fI\-slotOperation\fR? ?\fIclassName ...\fR?
.
This slot (see \fBSLOTTED DEFINITIONS\fR below)
sets or updates the list of additional classes that are to be mixed into
all the instances of the class being defined. Each \fIclassName\fR argument
names a single class that is to be mixed in.
By default, this slot works by replacement.
.TP
\fBrenamemethod\fI fromName toName\fR
.
This renames the method called \fIfromName\fR in a class to \fItoName\fR. The
method must have previously existed in the class, and \fItoName\fR must not
previously refer to a method in that class. Does not affect the superclasses
of the class, nor does it affect the subclasses or instances of the class
(except when they have a call chain through the class being modified). Does
not change the export status of the method; if it was exported before, it will
be afterwards.

.VE TIP500
.SH "SLOTTED DEFINITIONS"
Some of the configurable definitions of a class or object are \fIslotted
definitions\fR. This means that the configuration is implemented by a slot
object, that is an instance of the class \fBoo::Slot\fR, which manages a list
of values (class names, variable names, etc.) that comprises the contents of
the slot. The class defines five operations (as methods) that may be done on
the slot:
.TP
\fIslot\fR \fB\-append\fR ?\fImember ...\fR?

This appends the given \fImember\fR elements to the slot definition.

A consequence of this is that any use of a slot's default operation where the
first member argument begins with a hyphen will be an error. One of the above
operations should be used explicitly in those circumstances.
.SS "SLOT IMPLEMENTATION"
Internally, slot objects also define a method \fB\-\-default\-operation\fR
which is forwarded to the default operation of the slot (thus, for the class

.PP
The implementation of these methods is slot-dependent (and responsible for
accessing the correct part of the class or object definition). Slots also have
an unknown method handler to tie all these pieces together, and they hide
their \fBdestroy\fR method so that it is not invoked inadvertently. It is
\fIrecommended\fR that any user changes to the slot mechanism be restricted to
defining new operations whose names start with a hyphen.
.PP
.VS TIP516
Most slot operations will initially \fBResolve\fR their argument list, combine
it with the results of the \fBGet\fR method, and then \fBSet\fR the result.
Some operations omit one or both of the first two steps; omitting the third
would result in an idempotent read-only operation (but the standard mechanism
for reading from slots is via \fBinfo class\fR and \fBinfo object\fR).
