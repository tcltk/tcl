.SH NAME
eval \- Evaluate a Tcl script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBeval \fIarg \fR?\fIarg ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBEval\fR takes one or more arguments, which together comprise a Tcl
script containing one or more commands.
\fBEval\fR concatenates all its arguments in the same
fashion as the \fBconcat\fR command, passes the concatenated string to the
Tcl interpreter recursively, and returns the result of that
evaluation (or any error generated by it).
Note that the \fBlist\fR command quotes sequences of words in such a
way that they are not further expanded by the \fBeval\fR command.
.SH EXAMPLE
Often, it is useful to store a fragment of a script in a variable and
execute it later on with extra values appended. This technique is used
in a number of places throughout the Tcl core (e.g. in \fBfcopy\fR,
\fBlsort\fR and \fBtrace\fR command callbacks). This example shows how
to do this using core Tcl commands:
.CS
set script {
    puts "logging now"
    lappend $myCurrentLogVar
}
set myCurrentLogVar log1
# Set up a switch of logging variable part way through!
after 20000 set myCurrentLogVar log2

for {set i 0} {$i<10} {incr i} {
    # Introduce a random delay
    after [expr {int(5000 * rand())}]
    update    ;# Check for the asynch log switch
    eval $script $i [clock clicks]
}
.CE
.VS 8.5
Note that in the most common case (where the script fragment is
actually just a list of words forming a command prefix), it is better
to use \fB{expand}$script\fR when doing this sort of invokation
pattern.  It is less general than the \fBeval\fR command, and hence
easier to make robust in practice.
