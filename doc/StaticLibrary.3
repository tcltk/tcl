.SH NAME
Tcl_StaticLibrary, Tcl_StaticPackage \- make a statically linked library available via the 'load' command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTcl_StaticLibrary\fR(\fIinterp, prefix, initProc, safeInitProc\fR)
.sp
\fBTcl_StaticPackage\fR(\fIinterp, prefix, initProc, safeInitProc\fR)
.fi
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_LibraryInitProc *safeInitProc
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
If not NULL, points to an interpreter into which the library has
already been incorporated (i.e., the caller has already invoked the
appropriate initialization procedure).  NULL means the library
has not yet been incorporated into any interpreter.
.AP "const char" *prefix in
Prefix for library initialization function. Normally in titlecase (first
letter upper-case, all others lower-case), but this is no longer required.
.AP Tcl_LibraryInitProc *initProc in
Procedure to invoke to incorporate this library into a trusted
interpreter.
.AP Tcl_LibraryInitProc *safeInitProc in
Procedure to call to incorporate this library into a safe interpreter
(one that will execute untrusted scripts).  NULL means the library
cannot be used in safe interpreters.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure may be invoked to announce that a library has been
linked statically with a Tcl application and, optionally, that it
has already been incorporated into an interpreter.
Once \fBTcl_StaticLibrary\fR has been invoked for a library, it
may be incorporated into interpreters using the \fBload\fR command.
\fBTcl_StaticLibrary\fR is normally invoked only by the \fBTcl_AppInit\fR
procedure for the application, not by libraries for themselves
(\fBTcl_StaticLibrary\fR should only be invoked for statically
linked libraries, and code in the library itself should not need
to know whether the library is dynamically loaded or statically linked).
.PP
When the \fBload\fR command is used later to incorporate the library into
an interpreter, one of \fIinitProc\fR and \fIsafeInitProc\fR will
be invoked, depending on whether the target interpreter is safe
or not.
\fIinitProc\fR and \fIsafeInitProc\fR must both match the
following prototype:
.PP
.CS
typedef int \fBTcl_LibraryInitProc\fR(
        Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR);
.CE
.PP
The \fIinterp\fR argument identifies the interpreter in which the library
is to be incorporated.  The initialization procedure must return \fBTCL_OK\fR or
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR to indicate whether or not it completed successfully; in
the event of an error it should set the interpreter's result to point to an
error message.  The result or error from the initialization procedure will
be returned as the result of the \fBload\fR command that caused the
initialization procedure to be invoked.
.PP
\fBTcl_StaticLibrary\fR was named \fBTcl_StaticPackage\fR in Tcl 8.6 and
earlier, but the old name is deprecated now.
.PP
\fBTcl_StaticLibrary\fR can not be used in stub-enabled extensions.
