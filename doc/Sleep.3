.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Those procedures delays the calling process by the given time
and return after the time has elapsed.
The two variants of the command only differ in thue time unit.
\fBTcl_Sleep\fR uses milli-seconds, while, \fBTcl_SleepMicroSeconds\fR
uses micro-seconds.
They are typically used for things like flashing a button,
where the delay is short and the
application need not do anything while it waits.  For longer
delays where the application needs to respond to other events
during the delay, the procedure \fBTcl_CreateTimerHandler\fR
should be used instead of those commands.
.SH KEYWORDS
sleep, time, wait
