.SH NAME
ledit \- Replace elements of a list stored in variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBledit \fIlistVar first last \fR?\fIvalue value ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The command fetches the list value in variable \fIlistVar\fR and replaces the
elements in the range given by indices \fIfirst\fR to \fIlast\fR (inclusive)
with the \fIvalue\fR arguments. The resulting list is then stored back in
\fIlistVar\fR and returned as the result of the command. 
.PP
Arguments \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR are index values specifying the first and
last elements of the range to replace. They are interpreted
the same as index values for the command \fBstring index\fR,
supporting simple index arithmetic and indices relative to the
end of the list. The index 0 refers to the first element of the
list, and \fBend\fR refers to the last element of the list.
.PP
If either \fIfirst\fR or \fIlast\fR is less than zero, it is considered to
refer to the position before the first element of the list. This allows
elements to be prepended.
.PP
If either \fIfirst\fR or \fIlast\fR indicates a position greater than the
index of the last element of the list, it is treated as if it is an
index one greater than the last element. This allows elements to be appended.
.PP
If \fIlast\fR is less than \fIfirst\fR, then any specified elements
will be inserted into the list before the element specified by \fIfirst\fR
with no elements being deleted.
.PP
The \fIvalue\fR arguments specify zero or more new elements to
be added to the list in place of those that were deleted.
Each \fIvalue\fR argument will become a separate element of
the list.  If no \fIvalue\fR arguments are specified, then the elements
between \fIfirst\fR and \fIlast\fR are simply deleted.
