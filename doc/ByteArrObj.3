.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "const unsigned char" *numBytesPtr in/out
.AP "const unsigned char" *bytes in
The array of bytes used to initialize or set a byte-array value. May be NULL
even if \fInumBytes\fR is non-zero.
.AP Tcl_Size numBytes in
The number of bytes in the array.
.AP Tcl_Obj *objPtr in/out
For \fBTcl_SetByteArrayObj\fR, this points to an unshared value to be
overwritten by a byte-array value.  For \fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR,
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR and \fBTcl_SetByteArrayLength\fR, this points
to the value from which to extract an array of bytes.
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to use for error reporting.
.AP "Tcl_Size \&| int" *numBytesPtr out
Points to space where the number of bytes in the array may be written.
May be (Tcl_Size *)NULL when not used. If it points to a variable which
type is not \fBTcl_Size\fR, a compiler warning will be generated.
If your extensions is compiled with -DTCL_8_API, this function will return
NULL for byte arrays larger than INT_MAX (which should
trigger proper error-handling), otherwise expect it to crash.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These routines are used to create, modify, store, transfer, and retrieve
arbitrary binary data in Tcl values.  Specifically, data that can be
represented as a sequence of arbitrary byte values is supported.
This includes data read from binary channels, values created by the
\fBbinary\fR command, encrypted data, or other information representable as
a finite byte sequence.
.PP
A byte is an 8-bit quantity with no inherent meaning.  When the 8 bits are
interpreted as an integer value, the range of possible values is (0-255).
The C type best suited to store a byte is the \fBunsigned char\fR.
An \fBunsigned char\fR array of size \fIN\fR stores an aribtrary binary
value of size \fIN\fR bytes.  We call this representation a byte-array.
Here we document the routines that allow us to operate on Tcl values as
byte-arrays.
.PP
All Tcl values must correspond to a string representation.
When a byte-array value must be processed as a string, the sequence
of \fIN\fR bytes is transformed into the corresponding sequence
of \fIN\fR characters, where each byte value transforms to the same
character codepoint value in the range (U+0000 - U+00FF).  Obtaining the
string representation of a byte-array value (by calling
\fBTcl_GetStringFromObj\fR) produces this string in Tcl's usual
Modified UTF-8 encoding.
.PP
\fBTcl_NewByteArrayObj\fR and \fBTcl_SetByteArrayObj\fR
create a new value or overwrite an existing unshared value, respectively,
to hold a byte-array value of \fInumBytes\fR bytes.  When a caller
passes a non-NULL value of \fIbytes\fR, it must point to memory from
which \fInumBytes\fR bytes can be read.  These routines
allocate \fInumBytes\fR bytes of memory, copy \fInumBytes\fR
bytes from \fIbytes\fR into it, and keep the result in the internal
representation of the new or overwritten value.
When the caller passes a NULL value of \fIbytes\fR, the data copying
step is skipped, and the bytes stored in the value are undefined.
A \fIbytes\fR value of NULL is useful only when the caller will arrange
to write known contents into the byte-array through a pointer retrieved
by a call to one of the routines explained below.  \fBTcl_NewByteArrayObj\fR
returns a pointer to the created value with a reference count of zero.
\fBTcl_SetByteArrayObj\fR overwrites and invalidates any old contents
of the unshared \fIobjPtr\fR as appropriate, and keeps its reference
count (0 or 1) unchanged.  The value produced by these routines has no
string representation.  Any memory allocation failure may cause a panic.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR performs the opposite function of
\fBTcl_SetByteArrayObj\fR, providing access to read a byte-array from
a Tcl value that was previously written into it.  When \fIobjPtr\fR
is a value previously produced by \fBTcl_NewByteArrayObj\fR or
\fBTcl_SetByteArrayObj\fR, then \fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR returns
a pointer to the byte-array kept in the value's internal representation.
If the caller provides a non-NULL value for \fInumBytesPtr\fR, it must
point to memory where \fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR can write the number
of bytes in the value's internal byte-array.  With both pieces of
information, the caller is able to retrieve any information about the
contents of that byte-array that it seeks.  When \fIobjPtr\fR does
not already contain an internal byte-array, \fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR
will try to create one from the value's string representation.  Any
string value that does not include any character codepoints outside
the range (U+0000 - U+00FF) will successfully translate to a unique
byte-array value.  With the created byte-array, the routine returns
as before.  For any string representation which does contain
a forbidden character codepoint, the conversion fails, and
\fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR returns NULL to signal that failure.  On
failure, nothing will be written to \fInumBytesPtr\fR, and if
the \fIinterp\fR argument is non-NULL, then error messages and
codes are left in it recording the error.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR performs exactly the same function as
\fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR does when called with the \fIinterp\fR
argument passed the value NULL.  This is incompatible with the
way \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR functioned in Tcl 8.
\fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR is the more capable interface and should
usually be favored for use over \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR.
.PP
On success, both \fBTcl_GetByteFromObj\fR and \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR
return a pointer into the internal representation of a \fBTcl_Obj\fR.
That pointer must not be freed by the caller, and should not be retained
for use beyond the known time the internal representation of the value
has not been disturbed.  The pointer may be used to overwrite the byte
contents of the internal representation, so long as the value is unshared
and any string representation is invalidated.
.PP
On success, both \fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR and \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR
write the number of bytes in the byte-array value of \fIobjPtr\fR
to the space pointed to by \fInumBytesPtr\fR.  This space may be of type
\fBTcl_Size\fR or of type \fBint\fR.  It is recommended that callers provide
a \fBTcl_Size\fR space for this purpose.  If the caller provides only
an \fBint\fR space and the number of bytes in the byte-array value of
\fIobjPtr\fR is greater than \fBINT_MAX\fR, the routine will fail due
to being unable to correctly report the byte-array size to the caller.
The ability to provide an \fBint\fR space is best considered a migration
aid for codebases constrained to continue operating with Tcl releases
older than 8.7.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetByteArrayLength\fR enables a caller to change the size of a
byte-array in the internal representation of an unshared \fIobjPtr\fR to
become \fInumBytes\fR bytes.  This is most often useful after the
bytes of the internal byte-array have been directly overwritten and it
has been discovered that the required size differs from the first
estimate used in the allocation. \fBTcl_SetByteArrayLength\fR returns
a pointer to the resized byte-array.  Because resizing the byte-array
changes the internal representation, \fBTcl_SetByteArrayLength\fR
also invalidates any string representation in \fIobjPtr\fR.  If resizing
grows the byte-array, the new byte values are undefined.  If \fIobjPtr\fR
does not already possess an internal byte-array, one is produced in the
same way that \fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR does, also returning NULL
when any characters of the value in \fIobjPtr\fR (up to
\fInumBytes\fR of them) are not valid bytes.
.SH "REFERENCE COUNT MANAGEMENT"
.PP
\fBTcl_NewByteArrayObj\fR always returns a zero-reference object, much
like \fBTcl_NewObj\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetByteArrayObj\fR and \fBTcl_SetByteArrayLength\fR do not modify the
reference count of their \fIobjPtr\fR arguments, but do require that the
object be unshared.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetBytesFromObj\fR and \fBTcl_GetByteArrayFromObj\fR do not modify
the reference count of \fIobjPtr\fR; they only read.
