.SH NAME
Tcl_ReplaceChannel, Tcl_UndoReplaceChannel \- stack an I/O channel on top of another, and undo it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
Tcl_Channel
\fBTcl_ReplaceChannel\fR(\fIinterp, typePtr, clientData, mask, channel\fR)
.sp
void
\fBTcl_UndoReplaceChannel\fR(\fIinterp, channel\fR)
.sp
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_ChannelType
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
The Tcl interpreter in which \fIchannel\fP is registered.
.AP Tcl_ChannelType *typePtr in
The new channel I/O procedures to use for \fIchannel\fP.
.AP ClientData clientData in
Arbitrary one-word value to pass to channel I/O procedures.
.AP int mask in
Conditions under which \fIchannel\fR will be used: OR-ed combination of
\fBTCL_READABLE\fR, \fBTCL_WRITABLE\fR and \fBTCL_EXCEPTION\fR.
This can be a subset of the operations currently allowed on \fIchannel\fP.
.AP Tcl_Channel channel in
An existing Tcl channel such as returned by \fBTcl_CreateChannel\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These functions are for use by extensions that add processing
layers on top of Tcl I/O channels.  Examples include compression
and encryption modules.  These functions transparently stack and unstack
a new channel on top of an existing one.
Any number of channels can be stacked together.
.PP
\fBTcl_ReplaceChannel\fR
interposes a new channel type on an existing \fIchannel\fP.
After the call to \fBTcl_ReplaceChannel\fR,
any operation on \fIchannel\fP uses the I/O channel functions
defined in \fItypePtr\fP, and the channel functions are passed
the new \fIclientData\fP instead of the existing client data
for \fIchannel\fP.
A new channel structure is created under the same name that
exists for \fIchannel\fP, and the existing Tcl_Channel data structure
is linked using the channelPtr->supercedes structure member.
The new channel functions
should use Tcl_Read and Tcl_Write to get at the underlying channel.
Closing the new channel closes the channels stacked below it.
.PP
The set of operations allowed on the new channel can be restricted
by the new channel type. For example, a read-write channel may become
read-only after the \fBTcl_ReplaceChannel\fR
call.
.PP
\fBTcl_UndoReplaceChannel\fP restores the channel to its original state.
