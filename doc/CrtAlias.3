.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are intended for access to the multiple interpreter
facility from inside C programs. They enable managing multiple interpreters
in a hierarchical relationship, and the management of aliases, commands
that when invoked in one interpreter execute a command in another
interpreter. The return value for those procedures that return an \fBint\fR
is either \fBTCL_OK\fR or \fBTCL_ERROR\fR. If \fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned
then the interpreter's result contains an error message.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateChild\fR creates a new interpreter as a child of \fIinterp\fR.
It also creates a child command named \fIname\fR in \fIinterp\fR which
allows \fIinterp\fR to manipulate the new child.
If \fIisSafe\fR is zero, the command creates a trusted child in which Tcl
code has access to all the Tcl commands.
If it is \fB1\fR, the command creates a
.QW safe
child in which Tcl code has access only to set of Tcl commands defined as
.QW "Safe Tcl" ;
see the manual entry for the Tcl \fBinterp\fR command for details.
If the creation of the new child interpreter failed, \fBNULL\fR is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_IsSafe\fR returns \fB1\fR if \fIinterp\fR is
.QW safe
(was created with the \fBTCL_SAFE_INTERPRETER\fR flag specified),
\fB0\fR otherwise.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetChild\fR returns a pointer to a child interpreter of
\fIinterp\fR. The child interpreter is identified by \fIname\fR.
If no such child interpreter exists, \fBNULL\fR is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetParent\fR returns a pointer to the parent interpreter of
\fIinterp\fR. If \fIinterp\fR has no parent (it is a
top-level interpreter) then \fBNULL\fR is returned.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetInterpPath\fR stores in the result of \fIinterp\fR
the relative path between \fIinterp\fR and \fIchildInterp\fR;
\fIchildInterp\fR must be a child of \fIinterp\fR. If the computation
of the relative path succeeds, \fBTCL_OK\fR is returned, else
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned and an error message is stored as the
result of \fIinterp\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateAlias\fR creates a command named \fIchildCmd\fR in
\fIchildInterp\fR that when invoked, will cause the command \fItargetCmd\fR
to be invoked in \fItargetInterp\fR. The arguments specified by the strings
contained in \fIargv\fR are always prepended to any arguments supplied in the
invocation of \fIchildCmd\fR and passed to \fItargetCmd\fR.
This operation returns \fBTCL_OK\fR if it succeeds, or \fBTCL_ERROR\fR if
it fails; in that case, an error message is left in the value result
of \fIchildInterp\fR.
Note that there are no restrictions on the ancestry relationship (as
created by \fBTcl_CreateChild\fR) between \fIchildInterp\fR and
\fItargetInterp\fR. Any two interpreters can be used, without any
restrictions on how they are related.
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateAliasObj\fR is similar to \fBTcl_CreateAlias\fR except
that it takes a vector of values to pass as additional arguments instead
of a vector of strings.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetAliasObj\fR returns information in the form of a pointer to
a vector of Tcl_Obj structures about an alias \fIaliasName\fR
in \fIinterp\fR. Any of the result fields can be \fBNULL\fR, in
which case the corresponding datum is not returned. If a result field is
non\-\fBNULL\fR, the address indicated is set to the corresponding datum.
For example, if \fItargetCmdPtr\fR is non\-\fBNULL\fR it is set to a
pointer to the string containing the name of the target command.
.PP
\fBTcl_ExposeCommand\fR moves the command named \fIhiddenCmdName\fR from
the set of hidden commands to the set of exposed commands, putting
it under the name
\fIcmdName\fR.
\fIHiddenCmdName\fR must be the name of an existing hidden
command, or the operation will return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
leave an error message as the result of \fIinterp\fR.
If an exposed command named \fIcmdName\fR already exists,
the operation returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leaves an error message as
the result of \fIinterp\fR.
If the operation succeeds, it returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
After executing this command, attempts to use \fIcmdName\fR in any
script evaluation mechanism will again succeed.
.PP
\fBTcl_HideCommand\fR moves the command named \fIcmdName\fR from the set of
exposed commands to the set of hidden commands, under the name
\fIhiddenCmdName\fR.
\fICmdName\fR must be the name of an existing exposed
command, or the operation will return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and leave an error
message as the result of \fIinterp\fR.
Currently both \fIcmdName\fR and \fIhiddenCmdName\fR must not contain
namespace qualifiers, or the operation will return \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and
leave an error message as the result of \fIinterp\fR.
The \fICmdName\fR will be looked up in the global namespace, and not
relative to the current namespace, even if the current namespace is not the
global one.
If a hidden command whose name is \fIhiddenCmdName\fR already
exists, the operation also returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR and an error
message is left as the result of \fIinterp\fR.
If the operation succeeds, it returns \fBTCL_OK\fR.
After executing this command, attempts to use \fIcmdName\fR in
any script evaluation mechanism will fail.

\fIinterp(n)\fR.
.SH "REFERENCE COUNT MANAGEMENT"
.PP
\fBTcl_CreateAliasObj\fR increments the reference counts of the values
in its \fIobjv\fR argument. (That reference lasts the same length of
time as the owning alias.)
.PP
\fBTcl_GetAliasObj\fR returns (via its \fIobjvPtr\fR argument) a
pointer to values that it holds a reference to.
