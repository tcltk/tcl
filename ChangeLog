2002-06-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test:  More corrections to test suite so that tests
	of failing [test]s don't show up themselves as failing tests.

2002-06-07  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Tidied up headers in relation to float.h
	to cut the cruft and ensure DBL_MAX is defined since doubles seem
	to be the same size everywhere; if the assumption isn't true, the
	variant platforms had better have run configure...

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h (EOVERFLOW): Added code to define it if it
	wasn't previously defined.  Also some other general tidying and
	adding of comments.  [Tcl bugs 563122, 564595]
	* compat/tclErrno.h: Added definition for EOVERFLOW copied from
	Solaris headers; I've been unable to find any uses of EFTYPE,
	which was the error code previously occupying the slot, in Tcl, or
	any definition of it in the Solaris headers.

2002-06-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Remove hard coded CFLAGS=-g
	and add CFLAGS_DEBUG, CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE, and
	CFLAGS_DEFAULT varaibles. [Tcl bug 565488]

2002-06-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test:  Corrections to test suite so that tests
	of failing [test]s don't show up themselves as failing tests.

	* tests/io.test: Fixed up namespace variable resolution issues
	revealed by running test suite with "-singleproc 1".

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* tests/tcltest.test: Several updates to tcltest.
	  1) changed to lazy initialization of test constraints
	  2) deprecated [initConstraintsHook]
	  3) repaired badly broken [limitConstraints].
	  4) deprecated [threadReap] and [mainThread]
	[Patch 512214, Bug 558742, Bug 461000, Bug 534903]

2002-06-06  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpReaddir, TclpLocaltime, TclpGmtime):
	added mutex wrapped calls to readdir, localtime & gmtime in
	case their thread-safe *_r counterparts are not available.
	* unix/tcl.m4: added configure check for readdir_r
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): set TCL_DEFAULT_ENCODING to utf-8 on
	MacOSX (where posix file apis expect utf-8, not iso8859-1).   
	* unix/configure: regen
	* unix/Makefile.in: set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in parallel       
	to LD_LIBRARY_PATH for MacOSX dynamic linker.
	* generic/tclEnv.c (TclSetEnv): fix env var setting on
	MacOSX (adapted from patch #524352 by jkbonfield).

2002-06-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Tcl_Main.3: Documented $tcl_rcFileName and added more
	clarifications about the intended use of Tcl_Main(). [Bug 505651]

2002-06-05  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclGlob): mac specific fix to
	recent changes in 'glob -tails' handling.
	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* mac/tclMacChan.c: fixed TIP#91 bustage.
	* mac/tclMacResource.c (Tcl_MacConvertTextResource): added utf
	conversion of text resource contents.
	* tests/macFCmd.test (macFCmd-1.2): allow CWIE creator.

2002-06-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* tests/init.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test:	Added more TIP 85 tests from Arjen Markus.
	Converted tcltest.test to use a private namespace.  Fixed bugs in
	[tcltest::Eval] revealed by calling [tcltest::test] from a non-global
	namespace, and namespace errors in init.test.

2002-06-04  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update msys+mingw URL.

2002-06-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* tests/tcltest.test:  Implementation of TIP 85.  Allows tcltest
	users to add new legal values of the -match option to [test],
	associating each with a Tcl command that does the matching of
	expected results with actual results of tests.  Thanks to
	Arjen Markus.  => tcltest 2.1 [Patch 521362]

2002-06-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/namespace.n: added description of [namepace forget]
	behaviour for unqualified patterns [Bug 559268]

2002-06-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: reverting an accidental modification in
	the last commit.
	
2002-06-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Tcl.n: clarify the empty variable name issue ([Bug 549285]
	reported by Tom Krehbiel, patch by Don Porter).

2002-05-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl:  Fixed leak of slave interp in [pkg_mkIndex].
	Thanks to Helmut for report.  [Bug 550534]

	* tests/io.test:
	* tests/main.test:  Use the "stdio" constraint to control whether
	an [open "|[interpreter]"] is attempted.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclMathInProgress,TclExecuteByteCode
		ExprCallMathFunc):
	* generic/tclInt.h (TclMathInProgress):
	* unix/Makefile.in (tclMtherr.*):
	* unix/configure.in (NEED_MATHERR):
	* unix/tclAppInit.c (matherr):
	* unix/tclMtherr.c (removed file):
	* win/tclWinMtherr.c (_matherr): Removed internal routine
	TclMathInProgress and Unix implementation of matherr().  These
	are now obsolete, dealing with very old versions of the C math
	library.  Windows version is retained in case Borland compilers
	require it, but it is inactive.  Thanks to Joe English.
	[Bug 474335, Patch 555635].
	* unix/configure: regen

2002-05-30  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.h: removed exprIsJustVarRef and
	exprIsComparison from the ExprInfo and CompileEnv structs. These
	were set, but not used since dec 1999 [Bug 562383].

2002-05-30  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclGlob): fix to longstanding
	'knownBug' in fileName tests 15.2-15.4, and fix to a new
	Tcl 8.4 bug in certain uses of 'glob -tails'.
	* tests/fileName.test: removed 'knownBug' flag from some tests,
	added some new tests for above bugs.
	
2002-05-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure: regen'ed
	* unix/configure.in: replaced bigendian check with autoconf
	standard AC_C_BIG_ENDIAN, which defined WORDS_BIGENDIAN on
	bigendian systems.
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharNcmp): 
	* generic/tclInt.h (TclUniCharNcmp): use WORDS_BIGENDIAN instead of
	TCL_OPTIMIZE_UNICODE_COMPARE to enable memcmp alternative.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode INST_STR_CMP):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): changed the case for
	choosing the Tcl_UniCharNcmp compare to when both objs are of
	StringType, as benchmarks show that is the optimal check (both
	bigendian and littleendian systems).

2002-05-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c: Removed "dummy" reference to Tcl_LinkVar.
	It is no longer needed since Tcl_Main() now actually calls
	Tcl_LinkVar().  Thanks to Joe English for pointing that out.

2002-05-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): 
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): Use the macro version.
	* generic/tclInt.h (TclUniCharNcmp): Optimised still further with
	a macro for use in sensitive places like tclExecute.c

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharNcmp): Use new flag to figure out
	when we can use an optimal comparison scheme, and default to the
	old scheme in other cases which is at least safe.
	* unix/configure.in (TCL_OPTIMIZE_UNICODE_COMPARE): New optional
	flag that indicates when we can use memcmp() to compare Unicode
	strings (i.e. when the high-byte of a Tcl_UniChar precedes the
	low-byte.)

2002-05-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclUtf.c: added TclpUtfNcmp2 private command that
	mirrors Tcl_UtfNcmp, but takes n in bytes, not utf-8 chars.  This
	provides a faster alternative for comparing utf strings	internally.
	(Tcl_UniCharNcmp, Tcl_UniCharNcasecmp): removed the explicit end
	of string check as it wasn't correct for the function (by doc and
	logic).

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): reworked the string equal
	comparison code to use TclpUtfNcmp2 as well as short-circuit for
	equal objects or unequal length strings in the equal case.
	Removed the use of goto and streamlined the other parts.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): added check for
	object equality in the comparison instructions.  Added
	short-circuit for != length strings in INST_EQ, INST_NEQ and
	INST_STR_CMP.  Reworked INST_STR_CMP to use TclpUtfNcmp2 where
	appropriate, and only use Tcl_UniCharNcmp when at least one of the
	objects is a Unicode obj with no utf bytes.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): removed error
	creation in code that no longer throws an error.

	* tests/string.test:
	* tests/stringComp.test: added more string comparison checks.

	* tests/clock.test: better qualified 9.1 constraint check for %s.

2002-05-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (TclpRealloc, TclpFree): protect
	against the case when NULL is based.

	* tests/clock.test: added clock-9.1
	* compat/strftime.c:
	* generic/tclClock.c:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: fix for Windows msvcrt mem leak caused by
	using an env(TZ) setting trick for in clock format -gmt 1.  This
	also makes %s seem to work correctly with -gmt 1 as well as
	making it a lot faster by avoid the env(TZ) hack.  TclpStrftime
	now takes useGMT as an arg.  [Bug #559376]

2002-05-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fixes to Tcl_FSLoadFile when called on
	a file inside a vfs.  This should avoid leaving temporary 
	files sitting around on exit. [Bug #545579]
	
2002-05-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinError.c: Added comment on conversion of
	ERROR_NEGATIVE_SEEK because that is a mapping that really belongs,
	and not a catch-all case.
	* win/tclWinPort.h (EOVERFLOW): Should be either EFBIG or EINVAL
	* generic/tclPosixStr.c (Tcl_ErrnoId, Tcl_ErrnoMsg): EOVERFLOW can
	potentially be a synonym for EINVAL.

2002-05-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	=== Changes due to TIP#91 ===

	* win/tclWinPort.h: Added declaration of EOVERFLOW.
	* doc/CrtChannel.3: Added documentation of wideSeekProc.
	* generic/tclIOGT.c (TransformSeekProc, TransformWideSeekProc):
	Adapted to use the new channel mechanism.
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (FileSeekProc, FileWideSeekProc): Renamed
	FileSeekProc to FileWideSeekProc and created new FileSeekProc
	which has the old-style interface and which errors out with
	EOVERFLOW when the returned file position can't fit into the
	return type (int for historical reasons.)
	* win/tclWinChan.c (FileSeekProc, FileWideSeekProc): Renamed
	FileSeekProc to FileWideSeekProc and created new FileSeekProc
	which has the old-style interface and which errors out with
	EOVERFLOW when the returned file position can't fit into the
	return type (int for historical reasons.)
	* mac/tclMacChan.c (FileSeek): Reverted to old interface; Macs
	lack large-file support because I can't see how to add it.
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Seek, Tcl_Tell): Given these functions
	knowledge of the new arrangement of channel types.
	(Tcl_ChannelVersion): Added recognition of new version code.
	(HaveVersion): New function to do version checking.
	(Tcl_ChannelBlockModeProc, Tcl_ChannelFlushProc)
	(Tcl_ChannelHandlerProc): Made these functions use HaveVersion for
	ease of future maintainability.
	(Tcl_ChannelBlockModeProc): Obvious lookup function.
	* generic/tcl.h (Tcl_ChannelType): New wideSeekProc field, and
	seekProc type restored to old interpretation.
	(TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_3): New channel version.

2002-05-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* tests/winPipe.test: Applied patch for SF Tcl Bug #549617. Patch
	  and bug report by Kevin Kenny <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* win/tclWinSock.c (TcpWatchProc): Fixed SF Tcl Bug #557878. We
	  are not allowed to mess with the watch mask if the socket is a
	  server socket. I believe that the original reporter is George
	  Peter Staplin.

2002-05-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Invoke SC_ENABLE_SHARED before
	calling SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS so that the SHARED_BUILD
	variable can be checked inside SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Pass -non_shared
	instead of -shared to ld when configured with
	--disable-shared under OSF. [Tcl bug 540390]

2002-05-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: added prototype for TclpFilesystemPathType().
	* mac/tclMacChan.c: use MSL provided creator type if available
	instead of the default 'MPW '.

2002-05-16  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sf.net>

	* doc/CrtObjCmd.3: 
	Added Tcl_GetCommandFromObj, Tcl_GetCommandFullName
	(Tcl Bug #547987, #414921)

2002-05-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TtyOutputProc): #if/#endif-ed this function
	out to stop compiler warnings.  Also much general tidying of
	comments in this file and removal of whitespace from blank lines.

2002-05-13  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (SETBREAK): Solaris thinks ioctl() takes a
	signed second argument, and Linux thinks ioctl() takes an unsigned
	second argument.  So need a longer definition of this macro to get
	neither to spew warnings...

2002-05-13  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEvent.c: 
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: clean up all memory allocated by the
	filesystem, via introduction of 'TclFinalizeFilesystem'.
	Move TclFinalizeLoad into TclFinalizeFilesystem so we can
	be sure it is called at just the right time.
	Fix bad comment also.  [Bug #555078 and 'fs' part of #543549]
	* win/tclWinChan.c: fix comment referring to wrong function.
	
2002-05-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/load.test:
	* tests/safe.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test: Corrected some list-quoting issues and
	other matters that cause tests to fail when the patch includes
	special characters.  Report from Vince Darley.  [Bug 554068].

2002-05-08    David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* doc/file.n:
	* tools/man2tcl.c:
	* tools/man2help2.tcl:  Thanks to Peter Spjuth
	<peter.spjuth@space.se>, again.  My prior fix for
	single-quote macro mis-understanding was wrong.	 Reverted to
	reimpliment the 'macro2' proc which handles single-quote macros
	and restored file.n text arrangement to avoid single-quotes on
	the first line.  Sorry for all the confusion.

2002-05-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/man2tcl.c:
	* tools/man2help2.tcl: Proper source of macro error mis-
	understanding single-quote as the leading macro command found
	and repaired.

	* doc/file.n: Reverted to prior state before I messed with
	it.

2002-05-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Corrected [uplevel] quoting when
	[source]-ing test script in subdirectories.
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/load.test:
	* tests/main.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test: 
	* tests/unixInit.test: Fixes to test suite when there's a space
	in the working path.  Thanks to Kevin Kenny.

2002-05-07  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	-- Changes from Peter Spjuth <peter.spjuth@space.se>
	* tools/man2tcl.c: Increased line buffer size and a bail-out if
	that should ever be over-run.
	* tools/man2help.tcl: Include Courier New font in rtf header.
	* tools/man2help2.tcl: Improved handling of CS/CE fields.  Use
	Courier New for code samples and indent better.

	* doc/file.n:
	* doc/TraceCmd.3:  winhelp conversion tools where understanding
	a ' as the first character on a line to be an unknown macro.
	Not knowing how to repair tools/man2tcl.c, I decided to rearrange
	the text in the docs instead.

2002-05-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: fix to similar segfault when using 
	'glob -types nonsense -dir dirname -join * *'. [Bug 553320]
	
	* doc/FileSystem.3: further documentation on vfs.
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* tests/pkgMkindex.test: Fix to testsuite bugs when running out
	of directory whose name contains '{' or '['.

2002-05-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/basic.test: Fix for [Bug 549607]
	* tests/encoding.test: Fix for [Bug 549610]
	These are testsuite bugs that caused failures when the filename
	contained spaces. Report & fix by Kevin Kenny.

2002-05-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: fix to freeing a bad object 
	(i.e. segfault) when using 'glob -types nonsense -dir dirname'.
	* generic/tclWinFile.c: fix to [Bug 551306], also wrapped some 
	long lines.
	* tests/fileName.test: added several tests for the above bugs.
	* doc/FileSystem.3: clarified documentation on refCount
	requirements of the object returned by the path type function.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: moved TclpFilesystemPathType to the
	platform specific directories, so we can add missing platform-
	specific implementations.  On Windows, 'file system' now returns 
	useful results like "native NTFS", "native FAT" for that system.  
	Unix and MacOS still only return "native".
	* doc/file.n: clarified documentation.
	* tests/winFile.test: test for 'file system' returning correct
	values.
	* tests/fileSystem.test: test for 'file system' returning correct
	values.  Clean up after failed previous test run.
	
2002-04-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: change HP-11 SHLIB_LD_LIBS from "" to ${LIBS} so
	that the .sl knows its dependent libs.

2002-04-26  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/obj.test (obj-11.[56]): Test conversion to boolean more
	thoroughly.
	* generic/tclObj.c (SetBooleanFromAny): Was not calling an integer
	parsing function on native 64-bit platforms!  [Bug 548686]

2002-04-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: corrected TclRememberJoinableThread decl to
	use VOID instead of void.
	* generic/tclThreadJoin.c: noted that this code isn't needed on Unix.

2002-04-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/exec.n: 
	* doc/tclvars.n: doc updates [Patch #509426] (gravereaux)

2002-04-24  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacResource.r: added check of
	TCLTK_NO_LIBRARY_TEXT_RESOURCES #define to allow disabling the
	inclusion of the tcl library code in the resource fork of Tcl
	executables and shared libraries.

2002-04-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/TraceCmd.3: New file that documents Tcl_CommandTraceInfo,
	Tcl_TraceCommand and Tcl_UntraceCommand [Bug 414927]

2002-04-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclAlloc.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (new):
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: added new threaded allocator contributed by
	AOL that significantly reduces lock contention when multiple
	threads are in use.  Only Windows and Unix implementations are
	ready, and the Windows one may need work.  It is only used by
	default on Unix for now, and requires that USE_THREAD_ALLOC be
	defined (--enable-threads on Unix will define this).

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSRegister, Tcl_FSUnregister):
	corrected calling of Tcl_ConditionWait to ensure that there would
	be a condition to wait upon.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FileObjCmd): added cast in FILE_SIZE.

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoDeleteFile): check return of setattr API
	calls in file deletion for correct Win32 API handling.

	* win/Makefile.in: correct dependencies for shell, gdb, runtest
	targets.

	* doc/clock.n:
	* compat/strftime.c (_fmt): change strftime to correctly handle
	localized %c, %x and %X on Windows.  Added some notes about how
	the other values could be further localized.

2002-04-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main):  Free the memory allocated for the
	startup script path.  [Bug 543549]

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:  [mcmax] wasn't using the caller's
	namespace when determining the max translated length.  Also
	made revisions for better use of namespace variables and more
	efficient [uplevel]s.

	* doc/msgcat.n:
	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:  Added [mcload] to the export list
	of msgcat; bumped to 1.2.3.  [Bug 544727]

2002-04-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* mac/tclMacUtil.c: Modified TclpObjNormalizePath to be alias
	file aware, and replaced various calls to FSpLocationFrom*Path
	by calls to new alias file aware versions FSpLLocationFrom*Path.
	The alias file aware routines don't resolve the last component of
	a path if it is an alias. This allows [file copy/delete] etc. to
	act correctly on alias files. (c.f. discussion in Bug #511666)

2002-04-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/lindex.test (lindex-3.7): 
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetIntForIndex): Stopped indexes from
	hitting wide ints.  [Bug #526717]

2002-04-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* tests/info.test: [Bug 545325] info level didn't report
	namespace eval, bug report by Richard Suchenwirth.

2002-04-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/subst.n:  Clarified documentation on handling unusual return
	codes during substitution, and on variable substitutions implied
	by command substitution, and vice versa.  [Bug 536838]

2002-04-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoBodyCmd): 
	* tests/info.test (info-2.6): Proc bodies without string reps
	would report as empty [Bug #545644]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj): More clarification for
	comment on behaviour when substitutions are not well-formed,
	prompted by [Bug #536831]; alas, removing the ill-defined
	behaviour is a lot of work.

2002-04-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* tests/expr-old.test: fix for [Bug #542588] (Phil Ehrens), where
	"too large integers" were reported as "floating-point value" in
	[expr] error messages.

2002-04-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (EscapeFromUtfProc): 
	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteChars, Tcl_Close): corrected the handling
	of outputting end escapes for escape-based encodings.
	[Bug #526524] (yamamoto)

2002-04-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:  Removed [saveState] and [restoreState] from
	tcltest 2 documentation, effectively deprecating them.  [Bug 495660]
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Made separate export for commands
	kept only for tcltest 1 compatibility.

	* tests/iogt.test: Revised to run tests in a namespace, rather than
	use the useless and buggy [saveState] and [restoreState] commands
	of tcltest.  Updated to use tcltest 2 as well.  [Patch 544911]

2002-04-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: Revised to run tests in a namespace, rather than
	use the useless and buggy [saveState] and [restoreState] commands
	of tcltest.  Updated to use tcltest 2 as well.  [Patch 544546]

2002-04-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/proc-old.test: Improved stack trace for TCL_BREAK and
	TCL_CONTINUE returns from procs. Patch by Don Porter
	[Bug 536955]. 
	
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* tests/compile.test: made bytecodes check for a catch before
	  returning; the compiled [return] is otherwise non-catchable. 
	  [Bug 542588] reported by Andreas Kupries.

2002-04-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/socket.test:  Increased timeout values so that tests have
	time to successfully complete even on slow/busy machines.  [Bug 523470]

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* tests/tcltest.test:  Revised [tcltest::test] to return errors
	when called with invalid syntax and to accept exactly two arguments
	as documented.  Improved error messages.  [Bug 497446, Patch 513983]
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***: Incompatible with previous
	tcltest 2.* releases, found only in alpha releases of Tcl 8.4.

2002-04-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclNotify.c (TclFinalizeNotifier): remove remaining
	unserviced events on finalization.

	* win/tcl.m4: Enabled COFF as well as CV style debug info with
	--enable-symbols to allow Dr. Watson users to see function info.
	More info on debugging levels can be obtained at:
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvc60/html/gendepdebug.asp

	* tests/ioCmd.test: fixed iocmd-8.15 to have mac and unixPc variants.

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_ParseVar): conditionally incr obj
	refcount to prevent possible mem leak.

2002-04-08  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: no <sys/types.h> on mac.
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: minor fixes to Vince's changes from 03-24.
	* mac/tclMacOSA.c:
	* mac/tclMacResource.c: added missing Tcl_UtfToExternalDString
	conversions of resource file names.
	* mac/tclMacSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): fixed bug introduced
	by Andreas on 02-25; changed strcmp's to strncmp's so that
	option comparison behaves like on other platforms.
	* mac/tcltkMacBuildSupport.sea.hqx (CW Pro6 changes): added
	support to allow Tk to hookup C library stderr/stdout to TkConsole.
	* tests/basic.test:
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* tests/encoding.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* tests/ioCmd.test: fixed tests failing on mac: check for 
	existence of [exec], changed some result strings.

2002-04-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (Realpath): added a little extra code to
	initialize a realpath arg when compiling in PURIFY mode in order
	to prevent spurious purify warnings.  We should really create our
	own realpath implementation, but this will at least quiet purify
	for now.

2002-04-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj):
	* tests/subst.test:  Corrected [subst] so that return codes
	TCL_BREAK and TCL_CONTINUE returned by variable substitution
	have the same effect as when those codes are returned by command
	substitution.  [Bug 536879]

2002-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: added getMatchingFiles back (alias
	to GetMatchingFiles), which was a public function in tcltest 1.0.

2002-04-01  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEnv.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: invalidate filesystem cache when the
	user changes env(HOME).  Fixes [Bug #535621].  Also cleaned up
	some of the documentation.
	* tests/fileSystem.test: added test for bug just fixed.
	
2002-04-01  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinTime.c (Tcl_GetTime): made the checks of clock
	frequency more permissive to cope with the fact that Win98SE
	is observed to return 1.19318 in place of 1.193182 for the
	performance counter frequency.
	
2002-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TraceObjCmd, TraceVarProc)
	(TraceCommandProc, TclTraceCommandObjCmd):  corrected
	potential double-free of traces on variables by flagging in
	Trace*Proc that it will free the var in case the eval wants to
	delete the var trace as well. [Bug #536937]
	Also converted Tcl_UntraceVar -> Tcl_UntraceVar2 and Tcl_Eval to
	Tcl_EvalEx in Trace*Proc for slight efficiency improvement.

2002-03-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/AllowExc.3:
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjv,Tcl_EvalEx,Tcl_EvalObjEx):
	* generic/tclCompile.h (TclCompEvalObj):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj,TclExecuteByteCode):
	* tests/basic.test: Corrected problems with Tcl_AllowExceptions
	having influence over the wrong scope of Tcl_*Eval* calls.  Patch
	from Miguel Sofer.  Report from Jean-Claude Wippler.  [Bug 219181]

2002-03-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: Refactored CallTraces to collect repeated
	handling of its returned value into CallTraces itself.

2002-03-28  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/feather.bmp:
	* tools/man2help.tcl:
	* tools/man2help2.tcl:
	* win/makefile.vc: More winhelp target fixups.  Added a feather
	bitmap to the non-scrollable area and changed the color to be
	yellow from a plain white.  The colors can be whatever we want
	them to be, but thought I would start with something bold.
	[Bug 527941]

	* doc/SetVar.3:
	* doc/TraceVar.3:
	* doc/UpVar.3:  .AP macro syntax repair.

2002-03-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/man2help.tcl:
	* win/makefile.vc:  winhelp target now copies all needed files
	from tools/ to a workarea under $(OUT_DIR) and builds it from
	there.  No build cruft is left in tools/ anymore.  All paths
	used in man2help.tcl are now relative to where the script is.
	[Bug 527941]

2002-03-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/.cvsignore:
	* win/buildall.vc.bat:
	* win/coffbase.txt:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/nmakehlp.c (new):
	* win/rules.vc:  First draft fix for [Bug 527941].  More changes
	need to done to the makehelp target to get to stop leaving build
	files in the tools/ directory.  This does not address the syntax
	errors in the man files.  Having the contents of tcl.hpj(.in)
	inside makefile.vc allows for version numbers to be replaced with
	macros.
	
	The new nmakehlp.c is built by rules.vc in preprocessing and removes
	the need to use tricky shell syntax that wasn't compatible on Win9x
	systems.  Clean targets made Win9x complient.  This is a first draft
	repair for [Bug 533862].

2002-03-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx): passing the correct commandSize
	to TclEvalObjvInternal. [Bug 219362], fix by David Knoll.

2002-03-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx):
	* tests/basic.test: avoid exceptional returns at level 0 
	[Bug 219181] 

2002-03-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n ([mainThread]):
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* tests/tcltest.test:  Major code cleanup to deal with whitespace,
	coding conventions, and namespace issues, with several minor bugs
	fixed in the process.

	* tests/main.test: Added missing [after cancel]s.

2002-03-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/main.test: Removed workarounds for Bug 495977.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  Keep the value of $::auto_path
	unchanged, so that the tcltest package can test code that depends
	on auto-loading.  If a testing application needs $::auto_path pruned,
	it should do that itself.  [Bug 495726]
	Improve the processing of the -constraints option to [test] so that
	constraint lists can have arbitrary whitespace, and non-lists don't
	blow things up.  [Bug 495977]
	Corrected faulty variable initialization. [Bug 534845]

2002-03-25  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/CrtTrace.3: small doc correction
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteTrace): Allow NULL callback on
	trace deletions [Bug 534728] (Hemang Lavana).

2002-03-24  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjv): replaced obscure, incorrect
	code as described in [Bug 533907] (Don Porter).

2002-03-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  Use [interpreter] to set/query the
	executable currently running the tcltest package.  [Bug 454050]

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  Allow non-proc commands to be used
	as the customization hooks.  [Bug 495662]

2002-03-24  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n:
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test: (new file)	
	* tests/winFCmd.test: fix [Bug 511666] and [Bug 511658],
	and improved documentation of some aspects of the filesystem,
	particularly 'Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory' which now might match
	a single file/directory only, and 'file normalize' which
	wasn't very clear before.  Removed inconsistency betweens
	docs and the Tcl_Filesystem structure.  Also fixed 
	[Bug 523217] and corrected file normalization on Unix so that 
	it expands symbolic links.  Added some new tests of the 
	filesystem code (in the new file 'fileSystem.test'), and 
	some extra tests for correct handling of symbolic links.
	Fix to [Bug 530960] which shows up on Win98.  Made comparison
	with ".com" case insensitive in tclWinPipe.c
	
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***: But only between alpha
	releases (users of the new Tcl_Filesystem lookup table in Tcl
	8.4a4 need to handle the new way in which Tcl may call
	Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory, and 'file normalize' on unix now
	behaves correctly).  Only known impact is with the 'tclvfs'
	extension.

2002-03-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/basic.test (basic-46.1): adding test for [Bug 533758],
	fixed earlier today.
	
2002-03-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinInt.h: moved undef of TCL_STORAGE_CLASS. [Bug #478579]

2002-03-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjEx):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj): fixed the errorInfo for
	return codes other than (TCL_OK, TCL_ERROR) to runLevel 0 
	[Bug 533758]. Removed the static RecordTracebackInfo(), as its
	functionality is easily replicated by Tcl_LogCommandInfo. Bug
	and redundancy noted by Don Porter.

2002-03-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/expr.n: Improved documentation for ceil and floor [Bug 530535]

	[Patch 532642]
	* generic/tclDecls.h: 
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: make genstubs

2002-03-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	reported in bug 530320.

2002-03-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add configure time test for SEH
	support in the compiler.

	_except_checkstackspace_handler):
	* win/tclWinChan.c (ESP, EBP, Tcl_MakeFileChannel,

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (ESP, EBP, DoRenameFile,
	_except_dorenamefile_handler,
	DoCopyFile, _except_docopyfile_handler):
	Implement SEH support under gcc using inline asm.
	Tcl and Tk should now compile with Mingw 1.1. [Patch 525746]

2002-03-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile): Handle
	an SEH exception with EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER instead
	of restarting the faulting instruction with
	EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION. Bug 466102 provides an
	example of how restarting could send Tcl into an
	infinite loop. [Patch 525746]

2002-03-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile, DoDeleteFile,
	DoRemoveJustDirectory): Make sure we don't pass NULL or ""
	as a path name to Win32 API functions since this was
	crashing under Windows 98.

2002-03-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: Bumped tcltest package to 2.0.2.

2002-03-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl (getMatchingFiles): Pass
	a proper list to foreach to avoid munging a Windows
	patch like D:\Foo\Bar into D:FooBar before the glob.

2002-03-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c: Fix typo in comment.
	* generic/tclIO.c (DoReadChars, ReadBytes, ReadChars):
	Use NULL value instead of pointer set to NULL to make
	things more clear. Reorder arguments so that they
	match the function signatures. Cleanup little typos
	and add more descriptive comment.

2002-03-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update to indicate that Mingw 1.1 is
	required to build Tcl. Add section describing new
	msys based build process. Update Cygwin build
	instructions so users know where to find Mingw 1.1.

2002-03-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoCopyFile): correctly set retval to TCL_OK.

2002-03-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace):
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile): Replace
	hard coded constants with Win32 symbolic names.
	Move control flow statements out of __try blocks
	since the documentation indicates it is frowned upon.

2002-03-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/interp.n:
	* generic/tclInterp.c(Tcl_InterpObjCmd,SlaveObjCmd,SlaveRecursionLimit):
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* tests/interp.test: Added the [interp recursionlimit] command to
	set/query the recursion limit of an interpreter.  Proposal and
	implementation from Stephen Trier. [TIP 87, Patch 522849]

2002-03-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h, tools/tcl.wse.in, unix/configure.in,
	* unix/tcl.spec, win/README.binary, win/configure.in, README:
	Bumped patchlevel; this might need to change in the future, but it
	will help us distinguish between the CVS version and the most
	recent released version.

2002-03-06  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: for unshared objects, TclDecrRefCount now
	frees the internal rep before the string rep - just like the
	non-macro Tcl_DecrRefCount/TclFreeObj [Bug 524802]. 

2002-03-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsearch.n: Documentation of new features, plus examples.
	* tests/lsearch.test: Tests of new features.

2002-03-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4a4 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: initial remedy for [Bug #525783] flush
	problem introduced by TIP #35.  This may not satisfy true serial
	channels, but it restores the correct flushing of std* channels on
	exit.

	* unix/README: added --enable-langinfo doc.

	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in: fixed URL refs to use www.tcl.tk or SF.

2002-03-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:
	* mac/README:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/README:

	* unix/Makefile.in: added older ChangeLogs to dist target.

	* tests/io.test:
	* tests/encoding.test: corrected iso2022 encoding results.
	added encoding-24.*
	* generic/tclEncoding.c (EscapeFromUtfProc): corrected output of
	escape codes as per RFC 1468. [Patch #474358] (taguchi)
	(TclFinalizeEncodingSubsystem): corrected potential double-free
	when encodings were finalized on exit. [Bug #219314, #524674]

2002-03-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/encoding/iso2022-jp.enc: 
	* library/encoding/iso2022.enc: 
	* tools/encoding/iso2022-jp.esc:
	* tools/encoding/iso2022.esc: gave <ESC>$B precedence over <ESC>$@,
	based on comments (point 1) in [Bug #219283] (rfc 1468)

	* tests/encoding.test: added encoding-23.* tests
	* generic/tclIO.c (FilterInputBytes): reset the TCL_ENCODING_START
	flags in the ChannelState when using 'gets'. [Bug #523988]
	Also reduced the value of ENCODING_LINESIZE from 30 to 20 as this
	seems to improve the performance of 'gets' according to tclbench.

2002-02-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceCommandProc): ensure that TraceCommandInfo
	structure was also deleted when a command was deleted to prevent a
	mem leak.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateObjTrace): set tracePtr->flags
	correctly.

	* generic/tclTimer.c (TimerExitProc): remove remaining events in
	tls on thread exit.

2002-02-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c: allow cached fully-qualified namespace
	names to be usable from different namespaces within the same
	interpreter without forcing a new lookup [Patch 458872]. 

2002-02-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Replaced a few direct stack accesses 
	with the POP_OBJECT() macro [Bug 507181] (Don Porter).

2002-02-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/GetIndex.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct):
	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct):  Revised the
	prototype of the Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct to take its struct
	table as a (CONST VOID *) argument, better describing what it is,
	maintaining source compatibility, and adding CONST correctness
	according to TIP 27.  Thanks to Joe English for an elegant
	solution. [Bug 520304]

	* generic/tclDecls.h: make genstubs

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main,StdinProc):  Corrected some reference
	count management errors on the interactive command Tcl_Obj found by
	Purify.  Thanks to Jeff Hobbs for the report and assistance.

2002-02-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalTokensStandard): corrected mem leak
	in error case.

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestStatProc[123]): correct harmless UMRs.

	* generic/tclLink.c (Tcl_LinkVar): correct mem leak in error case.

2002-02-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/socket.test (2.7): Accepted and applied patch for Tcl SF
	  bug #523470 provided by Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>
	  to avoid timing problems in that test.

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TclpOpenFileChannel): Added code to regonize
	  "/dev/tty" (by name) and to not handle it as tty / serial
	  line. This is the controlling terminal and is special. Setting
	  it into raw mode as is done for other tty's is a bad idea. This
	  is a hackish fix for expect SGF Bug #520624. The fix has
	  limitation: Tcl_MakeFileChannel handles tty's specially too, but
	  is unable to recognize /dev/tty as it only gets a file
	  descriptor, and no name for it.

2002-02-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (StoreStatData): corrected mem leak.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): prevent obj leak in
	  remedial regsub case.

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_TranslateFileName): decr refcount for
	  error case to prevent mem leak.

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_ArrayObjCmd): removed extra obj allocation.

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c (Tcl_GetHostName): added an extra
	  gethostbyname check to guard against failure with truncated
	  names returned by uname.

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_SERIAL_PORT): added sys/modem.h check and defined
	  _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED for HP-11 to get updated header decls.

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: added Unix implementation of TIP #35, serial
	  port support. [Patch #438509] (schroedter)

2002-02-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmpCmds.c: (bugfix to the bugfix, hopefully the last)
	  Bugfix to the new [for] compiling code: was setting a
	  exceptArray parameter using another param which wasn't yet
	  initialised, thus filling it with noise.

2002-02-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Changed to recognize the
	  option "-error". Essentially ignores the option, always
	  returning an empty string.

2002-02-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/Alloc.3:
	* doc/LinkVar.3:
	* doc/ObjectType.3:
	* doc/PkgRequire.3:
	* doc/Preserve.3:
	* doc/TCL_MEM_DEBUG.3: Updated documentation to describe the ckalloc,
	ckfree, ckrealloc, attemptckalloc, and attemptckrealloc macros, and
	to accurately describe when and how they are used. [Bug #497459] (dgp)

	* generic/tclHash.c (AllocArrayEntry, AllocStringEntry):
	Before invoking ckalloc when creating a Tcl_HashEntry,
	check that the amount of memory being allocated is
	at least as large as sizeof(Tcl_HashEntry). The previous
	code was allocating memory regions that were one
	or two bytes short. [Bug #521950] (dejong)

2002-02-25  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx): avoiding a buffer overrun
	reported by Joe English, and restoring tcl7.6 behaviour for
	[subst]: badly terminated nested scripts will raise an error
	and not be evaluated. [Bug #495207]

2002-02-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: corrected strtoll prototype mismatch on Tru64.
	* compat/strtod.c (strtod): simplified #includes
	* compat/strtol.c (strtol): gather result in a long before returning
	as a long: necessary on platforms where sizeof(int) != sizeof(long).

2002-02-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c: updated to use Mac OS X 10.1 dyld APIs that
	have more libdl-like semantics. (bug #514392)

2002-02-25  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds: fixing a bug in patch dated 2002-02-22, in
	the code for [for] and [while]. Under certain conditions, for long
	bodies, the exception range parameters were badly computed. Tests
	forthcoming: I still can't reproduce the conditions in the
	testsuite (!), although the bug (with assorted segfault or panic!)
	can be triggered from the console or with the new parse.bench in  
	tclbench.
	
2002-02-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* compat/strtoul.c, compat/strtol.c, compat/strtod.c: Added UCHAR,
	CONST and #includes to clean up GCC output.

2002-02-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* compat/strtoull.c (strtoull):
	* compat/strtoll.c (strtoll):
	* compat/strtoul.c (strtoul): Fixed failure to handle leading
	sign symbols '+' and '-' and '0X' and raise overflow errors.
	[Bug 440916]  Also corrects prototype and errno problems.

2002-02-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Link with -n32
	instead of -32 when building on IRIX64-6.* system.
	[Tcl bug 521707]

2002-02-22  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c: renamed global variable emptyString ->
	tclEmptyString because it is no longer static.
	* generic/tclPkg.c: Fix for panic when library is loaded on a
	platform without backlinking without proper use of stubs. [Bug 476537]

2002-02-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/regexpComp.test: updated regexp-11.[1-4] to match changes
	in regexp.test for new regsub syntax

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added --enable-64bit support for AIX-4 (using -q64
	flag) when using IBM's xlc compiler.

	* tests/safe.test: updated safe-8.5 and safe-8.7
	* library/safe.tcl (CheckFileName): removed the limit on
	sourceable file names (was only *.tcl or tclIndex files with no
	more than one dot and 14 chars).  There is enough internal
	protection in a safe interpreter already.  Fixes [Tk Bug #521560].

2002-02-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds: [FR 465811]. Optimising [if], [for] and
	[while] for constant conditions; in addition, [for] and [while]
	are now compiled with the "loop rotation" optimisation (thanks to
	Kevin Kenny). 

2002-02-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	--- TIP#76 CHANGES ---
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): Final-argument-less
	[regsub] returns the modified string.
	* doc/regsub.n: Updated docs.
	* tests/regexp.test: Updated and added tests.

	* compat/strtoll.c (strtoll): 
	* compat/strtoull.c (strtoull): 
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Const-ing 64-bit compatability declarations.
	Note that the return pointer is non-const because it is entirely
	legal for the functions to be called from somewhere that owns the
	string being passed.  Fixes problem reported by Larry Virden.

2002-02-21  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/mkd.bat (removed):
	* win/coffbase.txt (new):
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc:  Changed the 'setup' target to stop using
	the mkd.bat file and just make the directory right in the rule.
	Same change to makefile.bc.  configure.in nor Makefile.in use
	it.

	coffbase.txt will be the master list for our "prefered base
	addresses" set by the linker.  This should improve load-time
	(NT only) by avoiding relocations.  Submissions to the list
	by extension authors are encouraged.

	Added a 'tidy' target to compliment 'clean' and 'hose' to remove
	just the outputs. Also removed the $(winlibs) macro as it wasn't
	being used.

	Stuff left to do:
	1) get the winhelp target to stop building in the tools/
	directory.
	2) stop using rmd.bat
	3) add more dependacy rules.

	* win/tclAppInit.c:  Reverted back to -r1.6, as the header file
	change to tclPort.h won't allow for easy embedded support
	outside of the source dist.  Thanks to Don Porter for pointing
	this out to me.

2002-02-21  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc:  Added a new "loimpact" option that sets the
	-ws:aggressive linker option.  Off by default.  It's said to
	keep the heap use low at the expense of alloc speed.

	* win/tclAppInit.c: Changed #include "tcl.h" to be tclPort.h to
	remove the raw windows.h include.  tclPort.h brings in windows.h
	already and lessens the pre-compiled-header mush and the randomly
	useless	#pragma comment (lib,...) references throughout the big
	windows.h tree (as observed at high linker warning levels).

2002-02-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h: Better guessing of LP64/ILP32 architecture, but
	now sensitive to presence of (suitable) <limits.h>

2002-02-20  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls (Tcl_RegExpRange,Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct):
	Overlooked a few source incompatibilities.  Now using CONST84.
	* generic/tclDecls.h: make genstubs
	* generic/tcl.h (Tcl_CmdObjTraceProc): silence warning from Sun
	Workshop compiler.

2002-02-20  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/buildall.vc.bat:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc: General clean-ups.  Added compiler and linker tests
	for a) the pentium 0x0F errata, b) optimizing (not all have this),
	and c) linker v6 section alignment confusion.  All these are tested
	first to make sure any D4002 or LNK1117 warnings aren't displayed.
	The pentium 0x0F errata is a recommended switch.  The v5 linker's
	section alignment default is 512, but the v6 linker was changed
	to 4096 in an attempt to speed loading on Win98.  I changed the
	default to always be 512 across both linkers, unless linking
	statically, then 4096 is used for the claimed speed effect. Using
	a 512 alignment saves 12k bytes of dead space in the DLL.

	Added IA64 B-stepping errata switch when the compiler supports it.

	Added profiling to $(lflags) when requested and also removed the
	explict -entry option as the default works fine as is.

	Removed win/tclWinInit.c from the special case section to let it
	use the common implicit rule as the $(EXTFLAGS) macro it had was
	never referenced anywhere.

2002-02-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h: Added code to guess the correct settings for
	TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG and TCL_WIDE_INT_TYPE when configure doesn't
	tell us them, as can happen with extensions.

2002-02-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/format.n: Updated docs to list the specification.
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Made behaviour on 64-bit
	platforms correctly meet the specification, that %d works with the
	native word-sized integer, instead of trying to guess (wrongly)
	from the value being passed.

2002-02-19  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: First draft of updated changes for 8.4a4 release.

2002-02-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: add strtoll/strtoull declarations for
	platforms that do not define them.

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (STRING_AT): removed ptrdiff_t cast and
	use of VOID* in default case (GNU-ism).

2002-02-15  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* compat/strtoll.c:
	* compat/strtoul.c:
	* compat/strtoull.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclPosixStr.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* generic/tclTestObj.c:
	* tests/get.test:
	* win/Makefile.vc: Further tweaks to the TIP 72 patch to make it
	compile under VC++.
	
2002-02-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tclExecute.c:
	* tclIOGT.c:
	* tclIndexObj.c: Touchups to the TIP 72 patch to make it
	  compileable under Windows again. The changes are not complete,
	  there is one nasty regarding _stati64

2002-02-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	+----------------------+
	| TIP #72 IMPLEMENTED. |
	+----------------------+

	There are a lot of changes from this TIP, so please see
	http://purl.org/tcl/tip/72.html for discussion of
	backward-compatability issues, but the main ones modifications are
	in:

	* generic/tcl.h: New types.
	* generic/tcl.decls: New public functions.
	* generic/tclExecute.c: 64-bit aware bytecode engine.
	* generic/tclBinary.c: 64-bit handling in [binary] command.
	* generic/tclScan.c: 64-bit handling in [scan] command.
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: 64-bit handling in [file] and [format]
	commands.
	* generic/tclBasic.c: New "wordSize" entry in ::tcl_platform.
	* generic/tclFCmd.c: Large-file support (with many consequences.)
	* generic/tclIO.c: Large-file support (with many consequences.)
	* compat/strtoll.c, compat/strtoull.c: New support functions.
	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure: 64-bit support and greatly enhanced
	cacheing.

	Most other changes, including all those in doc/* and test/* as
	well as the majority in the platform directories, follow on from
	these.

	Also coming out of the woodwork:
	* generic/tclIndex.c: Better support for Cray PVP.
	* win/tclWinMtherr.c: Better Borland support.

	Note that, in a number of places through the Unix part of the
	platform support, there are Tcl_Platform* references.  These are
	expanded into the correct way to call that particular underlying
	function, i.e. with or without a '64' suffix, and should be used
	by people working on the core in preference to the API functions
	they overlay so that the code remains portable depending on the
	presence or absence of 64-bit support on the underlying platform.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***: Extracted from the TIP

	SUMMARY OF INCOMPATIBILITIES AND FIXES 
	======================================

	The behaviour of expressions containing constants that appear
	positive but which have a negative internal representation will
	change, as these will now usually be interpreted as wide
	integers. This is always fixable by replacing the constant with
	int(constant).

	Extensions creating new channel types will need to be altered as
	different types are now in use in those areas. The change to the
	declaration of Tcl_FSStat and Tcl_FSLstat (which are the new
	preferred API in any case) are less serious as no non-alpha
	releases have been made yet with those API functions.

	Scripts that are lax about the use of the l modifier in format and
	scan will probably need to be rewritten. This should be very
	uncommon though as previously it had absolutely no effect.

	Extensions that create new math functions that take more than one
	argument will need to be recompiled (the size of Tcl_Value
	changes), and functions that accept arguments of any type
	(TCL_EITHER) will need to be rewritten to handle wide integer
	values. (I do not expect this to affect many extensions at all.)

2002-02-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_GetsObjCmd): Trivial fix for bug
	  #517503, a memory leak reported by Miguel Sofer
	  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>. The leak happens if an error
	  occurs for "set var [gets $chan]" and leak one empty object.

2002-02-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* djgpp/ (new directory)
	* djgpp/Makefile (new):
	* unix/tclAppInit.c:
	* unix/tclMtherr.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:  Early stage of DJGPP support for building
	Tcl on DOS.  Dynamic loading isn't working, yet.  Requires watt32
	for the TCP/IP stack.  No autoconf, yet.  Barely tested, but
	makes a working exe that runs Tcl in protected-mode, flat memory.
	[exec] and pipes will need the most work as multi-tasking on DOS
	has to be carefully.

2002-02-10  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/CrtObjCmd.3:
	* doc/CrtTrace.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* tests/basic.test: Added Tcl_CreateObjTrace,
	Tcl_GetCommandInfoFromToken and Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken.
	(TIPs #32 and #79.)

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Regenerated Stubs tables.
	
2002-02-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added -pthread for FreeBSD to EXTRA_CFLAGS and
	LDFLAGS.  Also triggered nodots only for FreeBSD-3.
	Added AC_DEFINE(_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS) for Solaris.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: added thread-safe versions of readdir,
	localtime, gmtime and inet_ntoa for threaded build. (jgdavidson)

	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): prevented ckfree being
	called on a pointer to NULL.

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinInit.c: Partial TIP 27 rollback.  Following routines
	restored to return (char *): Tcl_DStringAppend,
	Tcl_DStringAppendElement, Tcl_JoinPath, Tcl_TranslateFileName,
        Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString, Tcl_UtfToExternalDString,
	Tcl_UniCharToUtfDString, Tcl_GetCwd, Tcl_WinTCharToUtf.  Also
	restored Tcl_WinUtfToTChar to return (TCHAR *) and 
	Tcl_UtfToUniCharDString to return (Tcl_UniChar *).  Modified
	some callers.  This change recognizes that Tcl_DStrings are
	de-facto white-box objects.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: make genstubs

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: corrected use of C++-style comment.

2002-02-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/scan.test:
	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): corrected scan 0x... %x
	handling that didn't accept the 0x as a prelude to a base 16
	number.  [Bug #495213]

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileRegexpCmd): made early check
	for bad RE to stop checking further.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): added special case to
	search for simple 'string map' style regsub calls.
	Delayed creation of resultPtr object until an initial match is
	made, as the input string object can then be reused for no matches.
	(Tcl_StringObjCmd): optimization improvements to the STR_MAP
	algorithm for zero-length and nocase cases.

	* tests/regexp.test:
	* tests/regexpComp.test: extra code coverage tests.

	* tests/string.test: added 10.18 and 10.19 extra tests.

	* generic/regc_locale.c (casecmp): slight performance improvement.

2002-02-05  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl:
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:  Corrected use of http::error when
	::error was intended.  Bump to http 2.4.2.

2002-02-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (FileOutputProc): Fixed [bug 465765] reported
	  by Dale Talcott <daletalcott@users.sourceforge.net>. Avoid
	  writing nothing into a file as STREAM based implementations will
	  consider this a EOF (if the file is a pipe). Not done in the
	  generic layer as this type of writing is actually useful to
	  check the state of a socket.

	* doc/open.n: Fixed [Bug 511540], added cross-reference to 'pid'
	  as the command to use to retrieve the pid of a command pipeline
	  created via 'open'.

2002-02-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>
 
        * unix/tclLoadDyld.c: updated to use Mac OS X 10.1 dyld APIs that     
        have more libdl-like semantics. (bug #514392)

2002-02-04  Jim Ingham   <jingham@apple.com>

	* Merge with the current TOT.
	
2002-02-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/open.n: Fixed [Bug 511540], added cross-reference to 'pid'
	  as the command to use to retrieve the pid of a command pipeline
	  created via 'open'.

2002-02-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd): handle quirky about case
	earlier to avoid shimmering problem.

2002-02-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: io-39.22 split into two tests, one platform
	  dependent, the other not. -eofchar is not empty on the windows
	  platform.

2002-02-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c: fix to picky windows compiler problem
	  with the 'MainLoop' function declaration.

2002-01-31  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: TIP 27: Applied patch fixing CONST warnings on
	  behalf of Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>.

2002-01-30  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h: For each interface identified in the TIP 27
	  changes below as a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY, the source of the
	  incompatibility has been parameterized so that it can be
	  removed.  When compiling extension code against the Tcl header
	  files, use the compiler flag -DUSE_NON_CONST to remove the
	  irresolvable source incompatibilities introduced by the TIP 27
	  changes.  Resolvable changes are left for extension authors to
	  resolve.
	* generic/tclDecls.h: make genstubs

2002-01-30  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3: added documentation for 3 public
	functions which had been overlooked.  Fixes [Bug 507701].
	* unix/mkLinks: make mklinks

2002-01-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/regexpComp.test:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileRegexpCmd): enhanced to support
	-nocase and -- options.

2002-01-28  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_LOAD_TCLCONFIG):
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_LOAD_TCLCONFIG): Set TCL_LIB_SPEC,
	TCL_STUB_LIB_SPEC, and TCL_STUB_LIB_PATH to the
	values of TCL_BUILD_LIB_SPEC, TCL_BUILD_STUB_LIB_SPEC,
	and TCL_BUILD_STUB_LIB_PATH when tclConfig.sh is loaded
	from the build directory. A Tcl extension should
	make use of the non-build versions of these variables
	since they will work in both cases. This modification
	was described in TIP 34.

2002-01-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinReg.c (regConnectRegistryProc,RecursiveDeleteKey)
	(DeleteKey,GetKeyNames,GetType,GetValue,OpenSubKey,SetValue):
	redid the CONSTification as previous changes caused failing tests.

	* tests/regexpComp.test (new):
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c: added TclCompileRegexpCmd entry
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): corrected to return
	TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE instead of TCL_ERROR for parsing errors, so
	it only throws the error for runtime compile, in case the user
	modifies 'string'.
	(TclCompileRegexpCmd): first try at a byte-compiled regexp
	command.  It handles static strings and ^$ bounded static strings.
	(TclCompileAppendCmd): made TclPushVarName call always use
	TCL_CREATE_VAR as numWords is always > 2 at that point.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode:INST_LIST): correct
	possibly dangerous decr in macro call.

	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpFindVariable): CONSTification touch-up

	* win/tclWinReg.c (OpenSubKey): corrected bug introduced in
	CONSTification that dropped pointer reference.

	* ChangeLog.2000 (new file):
	* ChangeLog: broke changes from 2000 into ChangeLog.2000 to reduce
	  size of the main ChangeLog.

	Make -eofchar and -translation options read only for
	server sockets. [Bug 496733]
	
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_GetChannelOption, Tcl_SetChannelOption):
	Instead of returning nothing for the -translation option
	on a server socket, always return "auto". Return the empty
	string enclosed in quotes for the -eofchar option on
	a server socket. Fixup -eofchar usage message so that
	it matches the implementation.
	* tests/io.test: Add -eofchar tests and -translation tests
	to ensure options are read only on server sockets.
	* tests/socket.test: Update tests to account for -eofchar
	and -translation option changes.

	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteChars): Fix for SF #506297, reported by
	  Martin Forssen <ruric@users.sourceforge.net>. The encoding
	  chosen in the script exposing the bug writes out three intro
	  characters when TCL_ENCODING_START is set, but does not consume
	  any input as TCL_ENCODING_END is cleared. As some output was
	  generated the enclosing loop calls UtfToExternal again, again
	  with START set. Three more characters in the out and still no
	  use of input ... To break this infinite loop we remove
	  TCL_ENCODING_START from the set of flags after the first call
	  (no condition is required, the later calls remove an unset flag,
	  which is a no-op). This causes the subsequent calls to
	  UtfToExternal to consume and convert the actual input.

2002-01-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_GetsObjCmd): Fixed bug #504642 as
	  reported by Brian Griffin <bgriffin@users.sourceforge.net>,
	  using his patch. Before the patch the generic I/O layer held an
	  unannounced reference to the interp result to store the read
	  line into. This unfortunately has disastrous results if the
	  channel driver executes a tcl script to perform its operation,
	  this freeing the interp result. In that case we are
	  dereferencing essentially a dangling reference. It is not truly
	  dangling because the object is in the free list, but this only
	  causes us to smash the free list and have the error occur later
	  somewhere else. The patch simply creates a new object for the
	  line and later sets it into the interp result when we are done
	  with reading.

2002-01-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialSetOptionProc): Applied patch for SF
	  bug #500348 supplied by Rolf Schroedter
	  <schroedter@users.sourceforge.net>. The function modified the
	  contents of the the 'value' string and now does not do this
	  anymore. This is a followup to the change made on 2001-12-17.

2002-01-11  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Removed -GD compiler option.  It was intended
	for future use, but MS is again changing the future at their whim.
	The D4002 warning was harmless though, but someone using VC .NET
	logged it as a concern.  [Bug #501565]

2002-01-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Burn Tcl build directory

	casts to satisfy picky compilers.

	* generic/tclMain.c:  Bug fix: neglected the NULL case in
	TclGetStartupScriptFileName().  Broke Tk/wish.

2002-01-05  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Tcl_Main.3:
	* generic/tclMain.c:  Substantial rewrite and expanded documentation
	of Tcl_Main to correct a number of bugs and flaws:

		* Interactive Tcl_Main can now enter a main loop, exit
		  that loop and continue interactive operations.  The loop
		  may even exit in the midst of interactive command typing
		  without loss of the partial command.  [Bugs 486453, 474131]
		* Tcl_Main now gracefully handles deletion of its master
		  interpreter.
		* Interactive Tcl_Main can now operate with non-blocking stdin
		* Interactive Tcl_Main can now detect EOF on stdin even in
		  mid-command.  [Bug 491341]
		* Added VFS-aware internal routines for managing the
		  startup script selection.
		* Tcl variable 'tcl_interactive' is now linked to C variable
		  'tty' so that one can disable/enable interactive prompts
		  at the script level when there is no startup script.  This
		  is meant for use by the test suite.
		* Consistent use of the Tcl libraries standard channels as
		  returned by Tcl_GetStdChannel(); as opposed to the channels
		  named 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr' in the master interp,
		  which can be different or unavailable.
		* Tcl_Main now calls Tcl_Exit() if evaluation of [exit] in the
		  master interpreter returns, assuring Tcl_Main does not return.
		* Documented Tcl_Main's absence from public stub table
		* Documented that Tcl_Main does not return.
		* Documented Tcl variables set by Tcl_Main.
		* All prompts are done from a single procedure, Prompt.
		* Use of Tcl_Obj-enabled interfaces everywhere.

	* generic/tclInt.decls (TclGetStartupScriptPath,
	  TclSetStartupScriptPath): New internal VFS-aware routines for
	managing the startup script of Tcl_Main.
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: make genstubs

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestsetmainloopCmd,TestexitmainloopCmd,
	  Tcltest_Init,TestinterpdeleteCmd):
	* tests/main.test (new):  Added new file to test suite that
	thoroughly tests generic/tclMain.c; added some new test commands
	for testing Tcl_SetMainLoop().

	* tests/basic.test (basic-39.4): Greatly simplified test while
	still leaving it so that it crashes when run without the fix to
	the [foreach] implementation.
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_ForeachObjCmd): Stopped Bug #494348 from
	happening by not trying to be so clever with cacheing; if nothing
	untoward is happening anyway, the less efficient technique will
	only add a few instruction cycles (one function call and a few
	derefs/assigns per list per iteration, with no change in the
	number of tests) and if something odd *is* going on, the code is
	now far more robust.

	* tests/basic.test (basic-39.4): Reproducable script from Bug #494348

2002-01-02  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/string.test (string-11.51):
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharCaseMatch):
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_StringCaseMatch): Fault with matching
	case-insensitive non-ASCII patterns containing upper case
	characters.  [Bug #233257]

2001-12-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/init.tcl: make sure env(COMSPEC) on Windows is executed
	with the right case, as it may otherwise fail inexplicably.

2001-12-28  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c (MemoryCmd, TclFinalizeMemorySubsystem):
	Added the [memory onexit] command, intended to replace [checkmem].

	* doc/DumpActiveMemory.3: 
	* doc/memory.n: Updated documentation for [memory] and related
	matters.  [Bug 487677]

	* mac/tclMacBOAMain.c (Tcl_Main, CheckmemCmd): Removed all the
	machinery for the [checkmem] command that is completely duplicated
	by code in generic/tclCkalloc.c.

	* generic/tclBinary.c:
	* generic/tclListObj.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c: Removed references to [checkmem] in
	comments, referencing [memory active] instead, since it is
	documented.

2001-12-28  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacInit.c:
	* mac/tclMacTclCode.r: synced up tclInit features to unix/win:
	implemented TclSetPreInitScript support, use of existing tclInit 
	proc if defined, check of default encoding dir if set. Changed
	script library resource names to lowercase (i.e. same as
	corresponding files). Used Tcl_JoinPath instead of string append.
	Check that system encoding could be loaded before utf translating
	the LibraryPath.
	* mac/tclMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tclMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.r:
	* mac/tclMacResource.r: minor version resources cleanup

2001-12-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG, SC_PATH_TKCONFIG):
	Search for config file using exec_prefix instead of
	prefix when no --with-tcl or --with-tk argument is used. [Bug 492418]

2001-12-21  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: fixed incorrect SHLIB_LD_LIBS
	setting for MacOSX / Darwin.
	* unix/configure: Regen.

	filesystem support.
	* unix/mkLinks: Regen.

2001-12-19  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): corrected use of eolFix.tcl on
	working files.  It should operate on distributed files.  [Bug 495120]

2001-12-19  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/tcl.wse.in: Fix for #495120.  tcl.wse.in was
	stored in cvs with improper <eol>.  This resulted in
	corrupted <eol> when checked-out on translating CVS
	clients such as windows (CRCRLF) and mac (CRCR).

	is run, and the new "make shell" target.

2001-12-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Rename dltest to dlpkgs to

	built because dltest/ directory already existed.

2001-12-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialCheckProc): corrected time
	calculations to be unsigned. (schroedter)

2001-12-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Define new dltest target that
	simply does a cd to dltest/ before running make.
	There is no need for the separate configure
	script that was previously being used.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Subst into dltest/Makefile.
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Define LIBS using
	DL_LIBS, LIBS, and MATH_LIBS variables instead

	* unix/dltest/README: Update readme to account for new
	configure free implementation.
	* unix/dltest/configure: Removed.

2001-12-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_STUB_MAGIC): Added cast to force type to be
	an int and get rid of a persistent and pointless warning with
	SunPro compiler.

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c (Tcl_AttemptDbCkalloc,Tcl_AttemptDbCkrealloc): 
	* generic/tcl.decls (Tcl_AttemptDbCkalloc,Tcl_AttemptDbCkrealloc):
	Made the file parameters to these functions into CONST char *,
	like they always should have been to match the other Tcl*Db* API
	functions.

2001-12-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-12-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinNotify.c (Tcl_FinalizeNotifier): Stop Tcl on Windows
	from crashing when shutdown from a non-Tcl thread. Fixes Bug
	#217982 [orig. 5804] reported by Hugh Vu and Gene Leache.   I'm
	not convinced that the shutdown process is right even with this,
	but it was definitely wrong without...

2001-12-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* win/tclWinSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Fix for tcl bug item
	  #478565 reported by an unknown person. Bypasses all calls to

	* generic/tclExecute.c: consistency patch, to make all
	  instructions that pop a variable number of Tcl_Obj's off the
	  execution stack take the number of popped objects as first
	  operand. Modified *only* the new instructions
	  INST_LIST_INDEX_MULTI and INST_LSET_FLAT, so this has no effect
	  on bytecodes generated up to tcl8.4a3 inclusive.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: fix debug messages in INST_LSET_LIST. 

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileLindexCmd):

	better syntax errors in the fairly common case of an identifier
	without decorations by guessing based on the currently available
	functions.  Also made messages consistent between memdebug and
	ordinary builds.

2001-12-05  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-12-03  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Some install target bugs repaired along with
	$(TCLSTUBLIB) added to the dependencies rather than implicit through
	the dde and reg extensions which don't happen to always require it
	for some build types.

2001-11-30  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: Tcl_Preserve'ing VarTrace structures to avoid

2001-11-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (BINARY_SCAN_MAX_CACHE, Tcl_BinaryObjCmd,
	ScanNumber): Added caching scheme to reduce number of object
	allocations when doing scans of large repetitive binary strings.
	See comments in file for reasoning behind implementation.
	Suggested by Miguel Sofer in Patch #429916, but independently
	implemented.

2001-11-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/regsub.n, doc/regexp.n: Converted dangling references to
	METASYNTAX section into references to the re_syntax manual page.

	code for Win95/98.

2001-11-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Removed the Tk reference for the 'winhelp' target.
	Converge at install will need to be the solution for Tk and all other
	extensions.

2001-11-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test (cmdAH-24.2): Made test less sensitive to OS
	preemption, but perfection isn't practical [Bug 463189, reported
	by Don Porter.]

	* tests/switch.test (switch-9.*): Added tests to exercise more of
	the argument checking.  (switch-7.2,switch-7.3): Test changed
	behaviour slightly.
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SwitchObjCmd): Reworked argument parsing
	to be stricter about what it accepts.  This should make uses of
	the [switch] command be more maintainable.  [Bug 475397, reported

	in 2001-11-23 commit from Daniel Steffen.

2001-11-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add comments to better describe
	TCL_EXE and when it should be available.
	* win/Makefile.in: Add TCL_EXE variable to be used
	by rules like `make genstubs`. Don't set TCL_LIBRARY
	before running `make genstubs` since we will be running
	with a tclsh from the PATH not the one we build.

2001-11-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Add comctl32.lib
	to wish link libs. This change was originally added
	to Tk on 2001-11-09 but was not committed to Tcl.

2001-11-23  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	Up-port to 8.4 of mac code changes for 8.3.3 & various new
	changes for 8.4, some already backported to 8.3.4 (patch #435658)

	* generic/tclObj.c: added #include to fix missing prototype errors

	* generic/tcl.h: MAC_TCL: addition of ConditionalMacros.h and use of
	DLLIMPORT and DLLEXPORT like on other platforms.  ( => no longer need
	the .exp files and can remove use of #pragma export that never worked
	well)
	removed line continuation in #if clause as this breaks the mac
	resource compiler (note that *.r files include tcl.h)

	* mac/tclMacFile.c: fixed bug in permission checking code

	* mac/tclMacLoad.c: corrected utf8 handling, comparison of
	package names to code fragment names changed to only match on the
	length of package name, this allows for fragment names with version
	numbers appended

	* mac/tclMacInt.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* mac/tclMacTime.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: moved declaration of TclpGetGMTOffset()

	* mac/tclMacShLib.exp:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.exp:
	* mac/tclMacMSLPrefix.h: removed files

	* unix/Makefile.in: removed reference to .exp files

	* mac/MW_TclBuildLibHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TclBuildLibHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclHeaderCommon.h:
	* mac/MW_TclStaticHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TclStaticHeader.pch: new precompiled header files

	* mac/MW_TclAppleScriptHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclTestHeader.pch:
	* mac/tclMacCommonPch.h: revised precompiled header handling: now
	include a common header file 'MW_TclHeaderCommon.h' from all .pch
	files, the .pch files themselves now only setup #defines (e.g.
	BUILD_tcl, STATIC_BUILD, TCL_DEBUG, TCL_THREADS) like in makefiles on
	other platforms.

	* mac/tclMac.h:
	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* mac/tclMacInt.h: use of BUILD_tcl and TCL_STORAGE_CLASS like on other
	platforms, standardize #include'd files to what's done on other
	platforms, removed use of #pragma export.

	* mac/tcltkMacBuildSupport.sea.hqx: new archive of mac build support
	files & suggested build environment directory hierarchy: 
	'Building MacTclTk' & 'CW Pro6 changes' readme's.
	projects for MoreFiles 1.5.2 static & shared libraries.
	project & sources for 'pseudoCarbonSupport', see below.
	included XML versions of the projects for CW Pro5 or Pro7 users.

	* mac/tclMacProjects.sea.hqx: updated mac build project files:
	build support for CodeWarrior Pro6, UnivIntf 3.4 & shared runtime
	libraries: the MSL libraries and MoreFiles are no longer compiled into
	Tcl.shlb, all non-static binaries now use the Pro6 shared runtime
	libraries and MoreFiles.shlb.  These shlbs are merged into the standard
	Wish and TclShell, but 3rd party applications linking with Tcl.shlb or
	Tk.shlb need to setup access to them.  (see the "(sh-ppc)" targets
	for how to do this.)
	included XML versions of the projects for CW Pro5 or Pro7 users.
	use compat/strtod.c instead of MSL's strtod()
	use WASTE versions of MSL for tcl test target to avoid text buffer
	cutoff at 32k.
	Merging the full MSL.shlb and the other shlbs into Wish & TclShell
	makes them a bit larger than before, use unmerged binaries to avoid
	copying the shared code with every application, e.g. when deploying
	numerous Wish based droplets.
	Note that using CW Pro5 to compile extensions is in principle still
	possible, but need to link with Pro6 runtime libraries.
	Tclapplescript now loads and runs on CFM68k.
	Highly experimental "pseudoCarbon" support for Tcl only on OS 8/9:
	binaries in "Build:(Carbon):" link against CarbonLib instead of
	InterfaceLib, however the actual code has not been carbonized! i.e. it
	will not run on OSX and may not even run properly with CarbonLib. 
	This should in principle allow you to build & test OS9 CFM Carbon
	binaries that need to link with Tcl.shlb.  On OSX you can use the
	native Tcl.framework, but you have to build a MachO binary as there
	is no CFM glue lib for Tcl.framework.
	the library pseudoCarbonSupport.shlb manually loads the symbols
	from InterfaceLib that are not in CarbonLib but are needed by the
	uncarbonized code in Tcl.shlb and TclShell.

	* generic/tclMain.c: MAC_TCL: workaround for broken/non-standard isatty
	on MW Pro6, #include <unistd.h> instead of defining isatty

	* mac/tclMacPort.h: MW Pro6 changes for MSL fcntl.h, stat.h & isatty

	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c: add EXTERN to InstallConsole to enable DLL
	export via the TCL_STORAGE_CLASS mechanism.

	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c: fix for FSpDirectoryCopy API change

	* mac/tclMacLibrary.c: emit compile time error when
	TCL_REGISTER_LIBRARY and USE_TCL_STUBS are both defined at the same
	time in an extension, this use is not currently supported and will
	result in a crash when dynamically loading the extension.

	* mac/tclMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tclMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.r:
	* mac/tclMacResource.r: fixed obsolete copyrights/dates in version
	strings; updated version strings to standard usage; added support for
	'(Support Libraries)' subfolder for shared runtime libraries in
	unmerged binaries; commented out demo setting of "Tcl Environment
	Variables"; reorganized resources among these files to avoid 
	multiple copies in applications and shared libraries, the script
	libraries are now no longer duplicated in Tclsh but are only included 
	in the resources of Tcl.shlb.

	* mac/tclMacChan.c:
	* mac/tclMacSock.c: cast for *BlockMode

	* mac/tclMacUtil.c:
	* mac/tclMacMath.h: removed obsolete hypot() definition

	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* mac/tclMacNotify.c:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.c:
	* mac/tclMacUtil.c:
	* generic/tclThreadTest.c: renamed routines conflicting with standard
	Apple or MoreFiles headers (at compile or link time):
	GetGlobalMouse         -> GetGlobalMouseTcl
    	FSpGetDirectoryID      -> FSpGetDirectoryIDTcl
    	FSpOpenResFileCompat   -> FSpOpenResFileCompatTcl
    	FSpCreateResFileCompat -> FSpCreateResFileCompatTcl
	NewThread              -> NewTestThread
	the renamed MoreFiles *Tcl routines are just wrappers calling into the
	MoreFiles DLL.

	* mac/tclMacCommonPch.h:
	* mac/tclMacThrd.c:
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c: removed OLDROUTINENAMES define, renamed obsolete
	apple API names to modern equivalents; UH3.4 support: added #include
	<ControlDefinitions.h>, updated New*Proc() calls to New*UPP().

	* mac/tclMacUnix.c: added missing (Tcl_Obj ***) cast to
	Tcl_ListObjGetElements call

	* mac/tclMacAlloc.c: modernized TclpSysAlloc() to use temporary
	memory instead of system heap memory when available (MacOS
	>= 7.5 and possibly earlier, use of system heap has been
	discouraged for a long time and has many disadvantages, e.g. memory
	isn't paged out, and errors can very easily bring the system down);
	fixed crashing bug in TclpSysRealloc() and CleanUpExitProc() where
	memory was being accessed after having been deallocated; fixed
	memory leak in (de)allocation code (for every block ever allocated
	with TclpSysAlloc, a Ptr was leaked), if temporary memory is
	available, don't track allocated memory, instead use
	RecoverHandle() to get Handle from Ptr, otherwise use doubly linked
	list to correctly track memory and free all allocated memory; added
	new option for ConfigureMemory: MEMORY_DONT_USE_TEMPMEM, disables
	use of temporary memory even when it would be available, only
	necessary when writing e.g. a driver (using tcl??); increased
	fraction of application heap reserved for OS routines to 512K

	* compat/strftime.c: 
	* mac/tclMacTime.c:
	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls: 
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: timezone support for mac via 
	TclpGetTZName() like on windows, using an inverse timezone table
	adapted from tclDate.c to map gmtoffset in seconds gotten from
	the MacOS APIs to a  timezone string, as there is no good way to get
	this info from MacOS. I had to make up some unusual timezones and
	arbitrarily decide on the most standard of the multiple choices
	available for every timezone.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: workaround for a MSL bug/misfeature: for
	very small floats, MSL can return errno ERANGE but a
	non-zero value ( < LDBL_MIN however)
	
	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c: support for WASTE text library using
	temporary memory, setting has no effect if WASTE is not used.
	
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c: removed duplicate code from generic/tclPanic.c
	and added that file to projects instead.

	* tests/all.tcl: set tcltest::singleProcess 1 as multiple processes
	are not available on the mac.
	
	* tests/cmdAH.test: access time not available on the mac, skip the 
	atime touch test
	
	* tests/appendComp.test:
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:
	* tests/compile.test:
	* tests/exec.test:
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/lset.test:
	* tests/namespace.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test: added missing cleanups/tests/catches that
	caused tests to fail on the mac.

	* doc/tclvars.n: doc bug, env(PWD) should be env(HOME) [Bug 463834]
	
2001-11-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-8.8): Corrected test for Bug 219393.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken,CallCommandTraces):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ>c (Tcl_UntraceCommand):  Added Tcl_Preserve and
	Tcl_Release calls to prevent deletion of CommandTrace structures
	until all callers are done using them, preventing memory corruption.
	[Bug 453805]

2001-11-20  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/GetTime.3 (Tcl_GetTime):

	Changed all uses of TclpGetTime to Tcl_GetTime.  Added Tcl_GetTime
	to the Stubs table and the library documentation.  Added a
	TclpGetTime in tclUtil.c for backward compatibility of
	extensions. [Patch #483500, TIP#73]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TimeObjCmd): Corrected an error in the
	[time] command that caused incorrect results to be returned if the
	total duration of all iterations exceeded 2**31 microseconds.
	[Bug #478847]

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.h: Reran 'make genstubs'
	
2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c
	* generic/tclCompile.h: 
	* generic/tclExecute.c: moving all code relative to bytecodes from
	tclBasic.c to tclExecute.c - the functions RecordTracebackInfo and
	Tcl_ExprObj went to tclExecute.c, and new interface function was
	defined (TclCompEvalObj).
	The final objective of this sequence of moves is to provide a
	clean, clear-cut interface between Tcl's core and the
	compiler/engine subsystem.  

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c
	* generic/tclCompile.h: 
	* generic/tclExecute.c: factoring out of common code in tclBasic.c
	(new function TclInterpReady defined: it resets the interp's
	result, then checks that it hasn't been deleted and that the
	nesting level is acceptable). Passed the responsibility of calling
	it to the *callers* of TclEvalObjvInternal.

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c
	* generic/tclExecute.c: a better variant of the previous-to-last
	commit (restoring numLevels computations). The managing of the
	levels now has to be done by the *callers* of TclEvalObjvInternal  

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: missing variable declaration under
	TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG. 

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c: restoring the computations of iPtr->numLevels
	to the original logic (previous to buggy modifs on 2001-11-16).

2001-11-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tools/eolFix.tcl (new-file):
	* unix/Makefile.in: added EOL correction for Windows bat files to
	dist target. [Bug #219409] (davygrvy)

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): update of patch
	from 2001-11-16 that uses the old Tcl encoding check mechanism as
	a fallback to the original.  Also added a TCL_DEFAULT_ENCODING
	#define (defaults to iso8859-1).  Tcl will first try setlocale and
	nl_langinfo, and if that fails, guess based on certain LANG|LC_*
	env vars. [Patch #418645]

2001-11-19  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/buildall.vc.bat:  Added useful comments.

2001-11-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/compile.test: added a test for bug [Bug 483309]

2001-11-19  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* doc/file.n:
	* tests/winFCmd.test: improved speed of file normalization
	for Win95/98, and clarified docs on differences in file
	normalization between NT/2000 and the older operating systems.
	Added test to ensure normalization is correct.
	
2001-11-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclParse.c: Code reorganisation. Moved all evaluation
	functions from tclParse.c to tclBasic.c, so that now tclParse.c
	deals exclusively with parsing and all evaluations are done by
	code in tclBasic.c. The functions moved are: TclEvalObjvInternal,
	Tcl_EvalObjv, Tcl_LogCommandInfo, Tcl_EvalTokensStandard,
	Tcl_EvalTokens, Tcl_EvalEx, Tcl_Eval, Tcl_EvalObj and
	Tcl_GlobalEvalObj. 

2001-11-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-8.8): Added adapted version of Bug
	#219393 as new test; the test won't reliably show up the old
	problem unless it is being run under something like Purify, but
	something is better than nothing...

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_TraceVar2, Tcl_UntraceVar2): Added missing
	mask bits for trace result type and a check for a nonsense flag
	combination.
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceVarProc): Added missing test for NULL
	when deleting a trace that doesn't cause an error.

	* doc/TraceVar.3: Added documentation for change due to TIP#68.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceVarInfo): Removed problematic errMsg
	field from structure.
	(TraceVarProc): Removed references to errMsg field and changed
	handling of errors so that they returned a Tcl_Obj* containing the
	error string.  This minimizes the number of calls to the memory
	management subsystem.
	(TclTraceCommandObjCmd, TraceCommandProc): Removed references to
	errMsg field which was never used in command traces in any case.
	(Tcl_TraceObjCmd, TclTraceVariableObjCmd): Removed references to
	errMsg field and made variable traces register with
	TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT bit set.

	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC,TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT): 
	New constants to define how to handle the strings returned from
	trace callbacks [TIP#68]
	* generic/tclVar.c (CallTraces, Tcl_GetVar2Ex, TclGetIndexedScalar,
	TclGetElementOfIndexedArray, Tcl_SetVar2Ex, TclSetIndexedScalar,
	TclSetElementOfIndexedArray, Tcl_UnsetVar2, Tcl_ArrayObjCmd,
	TclDeleteVars, TclDeleteCompiledLocalVars, DeleteArray,
	TclVarTraceExists): Support for those new trace flags.

2001-11-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: patch for [Bug 483309] (petasis).

2001-11-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclListObj.c: removed a C++-style comment that
	  was inadvertently left in the source code.

2001-11-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/interp.test: 
	* generic/tclInterp.c (SlaveObjCmd): Corrected argument checking
	for '$interp alias|aliases|issafe'. [Patch #479560] (thoyts, hobbs)

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: added HAVE_LANGINFO code block.
	* unix/configure: regened
	* unix/configure.in: added SC_ENABLE_LANGINFO call
	* unix/tcl.m4: made SHLIB_LD_LIBS='${LIBS}' for FreeBSD* (meyer)
	Added modified version of Wagner patch to make use of nl_langinfo
	where possible to determine Unix platform encoding, instead of the
	inflexible built-in system.  This is used by default when
	possible, and can be disabled with --enable-langinfo=no.
	[Patch #418645] (hobbs, wagner)

2001-11-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c: moved Tcl_GetCommandFromObj and all defining
	code for tclCmdNameType objects to tclObj.c (from tclExecute.c). 
	This code has nothing to do with bytecodes.

2001-11-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:

	* tests/stack.test: consolidation of duplicated code (in
	TclExecuteByteCode and EvalObjv); renaming of EvalObjv to
	TclEvalObjv as it is not static anymore; restored consistency of
	level counts between compiled and directly evaled code.
	[Bug 480896]

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/tcl.dsp:  winhelp target fixes for non-NT systems.  It
	seems NMAKE under these remembers changed directories during
	commands.   A new tcltest feature from Peter Spjuth 
	<peter.spjuth@space.se> to specify a pattern file from the
	commandline and redirecting output to a file when not under
	NT with it's scrollback console.  Then it replays it, piped
	through more.  Added 2 new static "configurations" to tcl.dsp.
	I could keep adding more, but I think we should leave it up to
	the user for customizing it.

	Sticky-points left:  'profile' option.

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in:
	Avoid adding libc to the LIBS variable since it
	is not needed when linking with CC. If required
	when linking with LD it should be done on a case
	by case basis in tcl.m4.

2001-11-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc:
	* win/makefile.vc:  Fixed install target to adjust for the
	different build types.  Added a 'linkexten' option to link the
	win extensions inside the shell when built static.  Placed
	win/tclAppInit.c patch in SF patch DB for approval. 'profile'
	option not hooked in yet.  Everything else know is done.

	* win/tcl.dsp(new):
	* win/tcl.dsw(new):  Simple MsDev stub project files that calls
	makefile.vc.  Will help run Tcl in the debugger easier without
	confusing MsDev for where the .pdb files are.

2001-11-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	Print a message indicating that the user should
	run "make genstubs" when the generated tclStubInit.c
	file is out of date. We can't regenerate automatically
	since there may be no tclsh on the system and that
	would cause bootstrap problems. [Tcl bug 465874]

2001-11-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC in tclConfig.sh. It should be
	included by extensions that need to find Tcl include
	headers in the install location. The user can override
	the include install dir with --includedir so we need
	to record this information for extensions. [Tcl bug 421835]
	
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC.
	* unix/tclConfig.sh.in: Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC.
	* win/tclConfig.sh.in: Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC.

2001-11-07  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc:
	* win/makefile.vc: Dropped the NOMSVCRT macro and put it on the
	option list instead.  It makes more sense to me this way as
	NOMSVCRT=0 would only be the valid setting.  Fixed the dde and reg
	extension for building static.  Improved, but not perfected, the
	winhelp target.

2001-11-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Change minimum VC++ version to 5.X since
	4.X is known not to work.
	Indicate that Mingw is required and building with Cygwin
	gcc is not supported. Include instructions that indicate
	how to install Mingw and what URLs folks should use to
	download the supported version of Mingw.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Error out if user tries to compile the
	Windows version of Tcl with Cygwin gcc. Users should compile
	with Mingw gcc instead.

2001-11-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* generic/tclIO.c (ReadChars): Fixed bug #478856 reported by
	  Stuart Cassoff <stwo@users.sourceforge.net>. The bug caused loss
	  of fileevents when [read]ing less data from the channel than
	  buffered. Due to an empty input buffer the flag
	  CHANNEL_NEED_MORE_DATA was set but never reset, causing the I/O
	  system to wait for more data instead of using a timer to
	  synthesize fileevents and to flush the pending data out of the
	  buffers.

2001-11-06  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc (new):
	* win/makefile.vc:  Complete over/under rewrite to support numerous
	build options all from the commandline itself without needing to
	edit the makefile.  Now requires vcvars32.bat to be run prior to
	running nmake for bootstraping the environment.  Fully doc'd usage
	for it is in makefile.vc.  Commentary welcome.  Sticky points left
	are:

	1) winhelp target shows errors in the converting script.
	2) .rc scripts aren't getting the right #defines to build the correct
	   "OriginalFilename" strings. (have patch, won't commit yet)
	3) Naming convention with suffixes describing the buildtype are 'tsdx'
	   which will need public acceptance. ie. tclsh84tsx.exe is a (t)
	   threaded shell (s) statically linked to the core and (x) uses
	   msvcrt instead of libcmt.

2001-11-04  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl: made filesystem fallback proc
	::tcl::CopyDirectory more robust to vagaries of non-native
	filesystems.
	
2001-11-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: updated documentation and comments
	to clarify behaviour of 'file copy' wrt soft links.
	
2001-10-29  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: fix to '-types {f r}' bug in
	TclpMatchInDirectory (which could cause a UMR, as well as
	returning wrong results).  Also improved API for 'stat'
	to resolve [Bug#219258].
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c
	* win/tclWinInt.h: addition of improved stat API to internal 
	lookup table.
	* tests/fileName.test: two new tests for the above bug.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: some cleanup of comments and #ifdefs
	
2001-10-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory): Argument to access()
	was entryPtr->d_name instead of nativeEntry which failed when
	trying to check access for files in other than the current
	directory. [Bug 475941, reported by Georgios Petasis]

2001-10-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: Added stateUpdated member to struct TtyState.
	(TtyCloseProc,TtySetOptionProc,TtyInit): Use stateUpdated member
	of TtyState to decide whether it is necessary to reset a serial
	port when Tcl closes it.  Blindly resetting can cause Tcl to be
	sent an unexpected SIGTSTP when it is executing in the background
	[Bug 471374, reported by Chris Nelson]

2001-10-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* doc/ObjectType.3: Minor documentation fix, reported by David
	  N. Welton <davidw@users.sourceforge.net> directly to me.

2001-10-22  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: fix to stop test suite from hanging process
	under some versions of WinNT. [Bug #466102] (Kevin Kenny)
	
2001-10-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/clock.test (clock-8.1): 
	* generic/tclDate.c (RelativeMonth): 
	* generic/tclGetDate.y (RelativeMonth): corrected off-by-one-day
	error in clock scan with relative months and years during swing
	hours. [Bug #413397, Patch #414024] (lavana)

2001-10-18  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to bug in Tcl_FSChdir shown up
	by recent tclkit builds.

2001-10-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (PipeInputProc, PipeOutputProc): do immediate
	retry when error is returned with errno == EINTR.
	[Bug #415131] (leger)

2001-10-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclLoadAout.c (TclGuessPackageName): removed unused vars
	and fixed warnings. [Bug #446622] (lim)

2001-10-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c: changing a memcmp to strncmp to avoid a memory
	error detected by purify (thanks Jeff); modify style to agrre with
	the style guide. 
	
2001-10-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* generic/tclInt.decls (TclExpandCodeArray,TclGetInstructionTable):
	  Added to internal stubs table. Tclcompiler (Tclpro project)
	  needs them if used as loadable package under Windows. Changed
	  signatures. We don't want to describe compiler internal
	  structures in "tclInt.h".

	* generic/tclCompile.h: S.a. Removed function declarations.
	* generic/tclCompile.c: S.a. Adapted to changed signatures.

	each other, and to AC_SUBST even empty vars for win/tclConfig.sh

	* generic/tclFileName.c: minor code cleanup

	* generic/tcl.h: moved #define of WIN32 to tcl.h where __WIN32__
	is defined and added #ifndef check.

	* tests/http.test: added removeFile for outdata

	* tests/ioCmd.test: added catch around file removal, as Windows
	file locking throws errors.

	* tests/socket.test (socket-7.2): corrected to work on Win2K.

2001-10-12  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* tests/compile.test: new tests for [Bug 467523]; they are only
	effective if TCL_MEM_DEBUG was set during compilation.

2001-10-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclReleaseLiteral): insured that

	deletion [Bug 467523] (Ronnie Brunner)

2001-10-10  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h:  #include <winsock2.h> needed to get moved
	to after #include <windows.h> or wierd misunderstandings took
	place when -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0400 is set for outside code that
	requires knowledge of Tcl innards.  General header macro magic
	applied liberally...

2001-10-10  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test:	Corrected restore of ::env(LANG).

2001-10-09  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_SplitPath): corrected mem leak
	intro'd with VFS code where the result obj from Tcl_FSSplitPath
	was not getting freed.

2001-10-09  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* generic/tclLiteral.c: (TclReleaseLiteral) reverted previous

	not include big5, gb or euc* as those have different formats in

2001-10-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_FinalizeThread): moved freeing of

	* doc/fileevent.n: Accepted [Patch #465279] adding an example to
	  the fileevent manpage. Minor modifications to get a better
	  formatting. Report and patch by David N. Welton
	  <davidw@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* The changes below fix [Bug #462317] where Expect tried to read
	  more than was in the buffers and then blocked in the OS call as
	  its pty channel driver provides no blockmodeproc through which
	  the OS could be notified of blocking-behaviour. Because of this
	  the general I/O core has to take more care than usual to
	  preserve the semantics of non-blocking channels.

	  The problem was reported by "Kevin O'Gorman"
	  <kevin@kosmanor.com>.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ReadRaw): Do not read from the driver if
	  the channel is non-blocking and the fileevent causing the read
	  was generated by a timer. We do not know if there is data
	  available from the OS. Instead of going to the OS for more and
	  potentially blocking we simply signal EWOULDBLOCK to the higher
	  levels to cause the system to wait for true fileevents.
	  (GetInput): Same as before.
	  (ChannelTimerProc): Added set and clear of CHANNEL_TIMER_FEV.

	* generic/tclIO.h (CHANNEL_TIMER_FEV): New flag for channels. Is
	  set if a fileevent was generated by a timer, the channel is not
	  blocking and the driver did not provide a blockmodeproc. In that
	  case the I/O core has to be especially careful about going to
	  the driver for more data.

	  provided the patch.
	
	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Moved release of

2001-09-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: added extra processor definitions. (mstacy)

	* win/tclWinSock.c (SocketThread): corrected pointer cast for _WIN64.

	* win/tclWinNotify.c: removed unnecessary winsock include (it is
	  already in from tclWinPort.h).

	* win/tclWinPort.h: changed winsock.h include to winsock2.h.
	  Reverses change from 2000-11-16, but is necessary for WIN64.
	  Extensions should comply with defined OS words, or use #ifndef.

2001-09-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/socket.test: removed dependence on being run from same dir
	  as remote.tcl, which only now needs to be in the same dir as
	  this file.  [Bug #219326]

2001-09-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestcmdtokenCmd): corrected pointer
	  storage/retrieval for 64bit machines.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd):
	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): corrected handling of format
	and scan on 64-bit machines. [Bug #412696] (rmax)

	* unix/configure: regen'ed
	* unix/tcl.m4: added --enable-64bit support for HP-11 with the
	64-bit kernel.

	* tests/basic.test:
	* tests/cmdInfo.test: improved skip reporting of missing commands

	* tests/winFCmd.test: simplified error check for winFCmd-7.9

	* tests/winPipe.test: removed obsolete cat16 tests

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): fixed invalid usage
	of valuePtr in TRACE_WITH_OBJ in INST_EVAL_STK case. [Bug #462594]
	Changed INST_STR_CMP instruction to promote to Unicode strings
	only when one of the strings is already of Unicode type.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode):
	* generic/tclCompile.c (instructionTable):
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): INST_STR_MATCH -
	Updated to Int1 instruction type and added special case to use
	INST_STR_EQ instead when no glob chars are specified in a static
	string.

	* tests/{for.test,foreach.test,if.test,while.test}:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileForCmd, TclCompileForeachCmd,
	TclCompileIfCmd, TclCompileWhileCmd): Corrected the overaggressive
	compiling of loop bodies enclosed in ""s.  [Bug #219166] (msofer)

2001-09-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* generic/tclExecute.c: insured that execution stack errors are
	also detected at abnormal returns.

2001-09-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/socket.n: Added documentation to mention what happens when a
	server socket is created with port=0.  Removed an old change bar,
	and no new change bar because Tcl has always behaved this way as
	it is really a poorly-documented standards-defined OS feature.

	* tests/util.test (util-8.1): Test derived from code to detect the
	problem, but the test always works in the C locale, so beware if
	you are maintaining the code.
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclNeedSpace): Rewrote to be UTF-8 aware.
	[Bug 411825, but not that patch which would have added extra
	spaces if there was a real non-ASCII space involved. ]

2001-09-18 Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_PutsObjCmd): Rewritten to have saner and
	  faster argument handling.  Fixes bug #123552. Patch provided by
	  Donal K. Fellows <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>: #402564.

2001-09-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): On Linux, disable inlining when
	one of the compat/*.c routines is to be linked in. [Patch 440891]

2001-09-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: removed forced #define USE_TCLALLOC 1 for
	Windows.  This means the native system allocator will be used by
	default.  This should be binary and source compatible with
	extensions, as Tcl_Alloc is a properly stubbed function.

2001-09-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* generic/tclExecute.c: corrected small bug in [Patch 456668] -
	the varFramePtr was not restored in one possible exit.

2001-09-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* doc/tclvars.n:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c: disabled all compile and execution tracing
	functionality in standard builds; TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG is now
	necessary to enable it. [Bug 451858]

	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/configure.in:
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc:

	  versions to independent versions for dde and registry packages.

2001-09-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/regexp.test (regexp-20.1):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): had to adjust fix from
	2001-08-06 to actually duplicate the objects in certain cases.
	This is really a place where feather would have been essential.
	[Bug #461322]

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfPrev): corrected to return the proper
	location when the middle of a UTF-8 byte was passed in.
	[Tk Bug #450504]

	* ChangeLog.1999:
	* ChangeLog: broke changes from 199x into ChangeLog.1999 to reduce
	  size of the main ChangeLog.

2001-09-13  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/ioCmd.test: Changed the computation of the result for
	  iocmd-8.1[123] so that the tests work for single- and
	  multi-process execution of the testsuite. Depending on the
	  choice of the user stdout is a tty or not and thus reports
	  different channel options. Fixes [460993] reported by Don
	  Porter.

	* doc/ParseCmd.3:  
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObjCmd):
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclParse.c:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* tests/parse.test: Deprecate the use of Tcl_EvalTokens, replaced
	by the new Tcl_EvalTokensStandard. The new function performs the
	same duties but adheres to the standard return convention for Tcl
	evaluations; the deprecated function could only return TCL_OK or
	TCL_ERROR, which caused [Bug 219384] and [Bug 455151].
	This patch implements [TIP 56].
	
2001-09-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Invert the logic that checks for $GCC.
	Instead of checking for "$GCC" = "no" we check for
	"$GCC" != "yes" or simply swap the true and false
	blocks of code in an if statement. That way if
	GCC is set to "" everything will still work. [Bug 460991]

	* tests/appendComp.test:
	* tests/lsearch.test:
	* tests/namespace.test:

	one file from influencing tests in other files.  [Bug 460591]

2001-09-12  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls: reserved stub #481 for the implementation of
	[TIP 56]

2001-09-11  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3: Added documentation for Tcl_WriteRaw and
	  Tcl_ReadRaw [#414929].
	
	* doc/CrtChannel.3: Added documentation for Tcl_ChannelBuffered
	  and Tcl_GetTopChannel [#414929].

	* The changes below are a fix for [219253].

	* tests/socket.test: Removed _most_ instances of hardwired port
	  numbers for listening sockets. Remaining are the ports in all
	  tests with constraint 'doTestsWithRemoteServer'. These seem to
	  be designed for a more controlled environment and are usually
	  skipped when running the testsuite.

	* tests/io.test: Removed all instances of hardwired port numbers
	  for listening sockets.

2001-09-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (TclInExit): Corrected handling of tsd in
	late stages of finalization.  [Bug #419449] (darley)

	* tests/stack.test:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (AliasObjCmd): Check the numLevels to ensure
	that we aren't hitting some alias loop condition.  [Bug #443184]

2001-09-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Don't include . characters
	in the Tcl library name when building on FreeBSD 3.X and later
	systems. [Patch 450725]

	* doc/Tcl_Main.3: 
	* doc/CrtChannel.3: 
	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3: 
	* doc/GetStdChan.3: Enhanced the manpages with cross-references to
	  the new manpage and more explanations how these functions deal
	  with the standard channels in various situations.

	* doc/StdChannels.3: New manpage describing handling of the
	  standard channels by the Tcl library [402725].

2001-09-10  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/mkLinks (Tcl_FSLink): Updated to reflect 2001-08-23
	file system changes.

	* unix/tclLoadShl.c:  Added #include of tclInt.h; access to Tcl
	internals, notably TclpUnloadFile(), is required.  Thanks to
	Bob Techentin for report and patch.  [Bug 459305]

	* generic/tclInitScript.h (initScript):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TCL_REGISTRY_KEY, TclpSetVariables):  Removed
	vestiges of Tcl's old initialization from registry variables.
	[Bug 455645]

2001-09-10  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Also added 'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels' to
	  the internal platform specific stub table.

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpObjStat): Now added the call to
	  'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels' to this function. I don't know where
	  my head was last thursday (2001-09-06), but the call was
	  actually added to 'TclpObjChdir', i.e. the implementation of
	  [cd]. Corrected this now. Thanks to Vince Darley for spotting
	  this.

2001-09-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/proc.test: made [proc] bytecompile a no-op for procs
	defined with _args_ as single argument and an empty body.
	[FQ 451441] 
	
2001-09-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Use () around variable name
	instead of {}. Use TCLTEST variable directly
	instead of depending on the tcltest alias.

2001-09-09  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:  Reminder from David Cuthbert <dacut@kanga.org>
	that I hadn't finished the Borland compatibility stuff.
	[Patch: 436116]

2001-09-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: Modify cmdAH-20.5 and cmdAH-24.8
	to display the file atime or mtime results if
	the test fails.

2001-09-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/mkd.bat:
	* win/rmd.bat: made these text files, text files again.
	[Patch: 451333]

2001-09-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/mkd.bat:
	* win/rmd.bat:
	Apply binary property (cvs admin -kb) to files and convert
	to CRLF linefeed format to fix the VC++ build. [Bug #219409]

2001-09-08 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* generic/tclFCmd.c:
	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: removed Tcl_FSCopyFile fallback
	to channel copying, since the channels will not have
	access to interpreters and the channel copying currently
	requires an interp.  Code which required cross-platform
	copies always has interpreters, so that solves the problem.
	Fixes bug in TclKit.
	
2001-09-07  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tcl.m4: Added -link50compat option so a VC6 linker makes
	a VC5 (pre sp3) compatible import library.
	[Bug: 219257]

2001-09-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (TclpThreadExit): Cast status argument to
	_endthreadex to unsigned instead of DWORD to match the Win32
	function prototype.

2001-09-06  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All the changes below serve to fix bug [219148] which reports a
	  80x performance hit for file I/O on Win* systems. On my system
	  it was closer to a 120x hit. Problem report by Uwe Traum <no
	  email address available>.

	  The fix goes like this: The obstacle is 'FlushFileBuffers',
	  executed whenever Tcl writes data to the OS, as Tcl has to wait
	  for the disk to complete I/O, and disks are slow. We remove that
	  obstacle. This opens another problem, [file size] reports back
	  wrong numbers. So for [file size] we add the call back in. As
	  optimization we keep track of the channels which were written to
	  and flush only these.

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpObjStat): Added a call to
	  'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels'. This ensures that [file size] and
	  related commands report the correct size of a file even if Tcl
	  has recently written to it. Unixoid OS's always report the
	  correct size even for files with pending data, but Win*
	  syssystem don't. They only report what is actually on disk.

	* win/tclWinInt.h: Added declaration of
	  'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels', making it available to other parts
	  of the tcl core.

	* win/tclWinChan.c (TclWinFlushDirtyChannels): New, internal,
	  procedure. Goes through the list of open file channels and
	  forces the OS to flush its file buffers for all which were
	  written to since the last call of this function. This is an
	  expensive operation as Tcl has to wait for the OS to complete
	  actual writes to the disk.

	  (FileInfo): Added dirty flag required by the procedure above.

	  (FileOutputProc): Removed flushing of file buffers, setting the
	  dirty flag instead. This means that the previously incurred
	  delays do not happen anymore.

	  (TclWinOpenFileChannel): Added initialization of 'dirty' flag.

2001-09-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/http.n: noted -binary, charset and coding state keys.
	* tests/http.test:
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/http/http.tcl (geturl): correctly get charset parameter
	and convert text according to specified encoding (if known).  RFC
	iso8859-1 is used by default.  Also recognize Content-encoding to
	see if we should do binary translation.  Added a CYA -binary
	switch for the cases that were missed. [Bug #219211 #219399]

	* tests/ioUtil.test: changed to make better use of constraints and
	remove knownBug constraints that weren't valid.

2001-09-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-3.2): Updated test to support
	  newer HP-UX releases that properly report euc-jp as the system
	  encoding for Japanese.  Bug report and patch verification by Bob
	  Techentin.  [Bug 453883]

	* doc/http.n:
	* library/http/*.tcl:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* tools/tclmin.wse:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/{Mm}akefile.*:  Updated http package to version 2.4,
	reflecting the new features just added.

2001-09-06 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c: tests of old-fs hooks no longer cause problems
	in threaded builds.  Also removed unused unload proc.
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclIOUtilc: added Tcl_FSMountsChanged so that a vfs
	can inform the filesystem that the filesystem epoch must be
	changed (since cached filesystems may now be incorrect).  Fixes
	problem running tclvfs extension.
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: if tests aren't in a native
	filesystem, then don't use pipes to run them. [Bug 458741]
	
2001-09-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.decls (479 generic): 
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Seek,Tcl_Tell,Tcl_OutputBuffered): Added
	public function to return the size of the output buffer and
	reworked other channel functions to use this shared functionality
	and that of Tcl_InputBuffered() too. [TIP#49, Rolf Schroedter]

2001-09-05  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:  Another small trim finalizing Borland
	support.

	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinPort.h:  More Borland compatibility fixes.  Changed
	EDQUOT #define from 49 to 69.  Borland had a clash as it was already
	using this number.  Upon advice from Helmut Giese, EDQUOT has been
	found in other header files #defined as 69.
	[Patch: 436116]

	* win/.cvsignore:  A few more glob patterns added.

	* win/makefile.bc (new):  Borland lives once more! rejoice..
	* generic/tclAlloc.c: Small Borland compatibility fix.
	* win/tclWinTime.c:  More Borland compatibility fixes.
	[Patch: 436116]

2001-09-05 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winFCmd.test: made notWin2000 constraint false if not
	running on Windows at all.
	
2001-09-04  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c:  Revisited _beginthreadex() stuff.  Instead
	of assuming a c-runtime implimentation of _beginthreadex normal,
	I reversed the logic to not assume, and use when is by explicitly
	needing to add runtimes that support it such as Borland.

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:  Borland compatibility change so
	ClientData was properly typed as a void* and TCHAR would not be
	defined twice.

	* generic/tcl.h:  Removed a small mistake from before.  Changes to
	the EXTERN macro for proper Borland compatibility will have to see
	a TIP.  What's this with the MS compiler:

		__declspec(dllexport) int func (int a, int b);

	will have to be this with Borland:

		int __cdecl __export func (int a, int b);

	The order of the attribute needs to be after the return type.

2001-09-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* compat/strtod.c (strtod):  Fixed failure to handle expressions
	like 3eq2 and failure to set errno on overflow.  [Bug 440894]

2001-09-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/proc.test: made [proc] check that formal args have
	simple names [Bug 458548] 

2001-09-04 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	Minor bug fixes in filesystem, plus small vfs changes as a 
	result of enabling the test filesystem to work properly.
	* tests/fileName.test: ensure new test cleans up after itself
	* doc/filename.n: 
	* generic/tclFileName.c: improved Mac path handling and document
	why [Bug: 421842] on Windows handling of UNC paths is not valid.
	Documentation and code now much clearer on what is and is not a 
	UNC path.
	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c:
	* generic/tclFCmd.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fixed error message, fixed [Bug: 453512]
	about dangerous use of tmpnam, replaced with mkstemp.  
	Documented all the changes.
	* generic/tclTest.c: made test vfs fully functional as a 
	'reporting filesystem'.
	* generic/tcl.stubs:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* doc/file.n:
	* various platform-specific 'TclpLoadFile': fixed comments about 
	unload behaviour, and completed objectification of loading.
	Required change to Tcl_Filesystem lookup table, so incompatible
	with 8.4a3, but not older versions of Tcl.  The change also
	allows 'link' and 'reporting' filesystems to function correctly
	when loading files.  Implementation of 'file delete -force'
	copes with case where cwd is inside the directory.  Moved
	overlooked Tcl_FSGetPathType from internal to external API.
	Made sure filesystems which are registered and then unregistered
	are only freed when all references to them are gone.
	Documented changes.
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: when deleting directories recursively,
	make sure permissions are ok.  Together with the above, this
	fixes [Bug: 219139]
	* tests/winFCmd.test: differentiated test results for win2k 
	versus not.  This fixes [Bug: 219239]
	* tests/fCmd.test: added tests for 'file delete -force' where
	the cwd is inside, and when permissions are inadequate.
	
2001-09-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: fixed incorrect operands for INST_LIST
	[Bug: 458241] (David Cuthbert, dacut@users.sourceforge.net)

2001-09-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): fixed missing comma
	in debug macro.

2001-09-03  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/ExprLongObj.3: Fixed error in documentation of argument type
	to Tcl_ExprObj [Bug: 457435]

2001-09-02  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c:  Portability fix for Cygwin who's c-runtime,
	not surprisingly, doesn't have the MSVCRT specific _beginthreadex /
	_endthreadex pair.  This might have to be revisited for proper
	Borland, lcc32, Watcom and other support as well.
	[Patch: 444255]

	* win/tclWinThrd.c:  Moved FinalizeConditionEvent() proto to within
	the main #ifdef TCL_THREADS block to avoid mingw warning about it
	being there but unused.

	* win/makefile.vc:  Added -Zl (zee el) to tclStubLib.c compile line
	to make sure the tclstub84.lib static library is built without
	requiring a specific C-runtime library at link-time for the end-use
	developer.  It has been noted on c.l.t that this trips many first
	time users trying to make extensions.
	[Patch: 403533]

2001-08-31  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: added TclCompileListCmd header
	* generic/tclBasic.c: added TclCompileListCmd compile proc
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileListCmd): function to compile
	the 'list' command at parse time.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): definition of
	INST_LIST bytecode.

	* doc/StringObj.3: added words of warning to use Tcl_ResetResult
	with the Tcl_Append* functions.

	* tests/compile.test: added compile-11.* interp result checks
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetIntForIndex): added Tcl_ResetResult
	before Tcl_AppendStringsToObj to prevent shared object crash when
	called from bcc instruction.  The Tcl_Append* calls that append to
	the result object that are invoked by bcc insts must remember to
	call Tcl_ResetResult because the bcc doesn't do this for us.
	[Bug #456892]

2001-08-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c: fixed some casting problems that upset
	Crays. [Bug #419528] (andreasen)

2001-08-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Silence warning from Sun compiler. [Bug 454374]

2001-08-30  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: allow cached fully-qualified command names
	to be usable from different namespaces within the same interpreter
	without forcing a new lookup. This speeds up scripts that pass
	command names in variables ("this" in some OO packages).
	[Patch 456668]. 

2001-08-30 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	Further fs updates.  After examining the most common Tcl
	extensions (TclX, BLT, Tk, TclPro, Mktclapp), it has been
	determined that only TclpGetCwd and the Access/Stat/Open
	insert/delete hooks of the internal fs functions are ever used.
	The remaining functions from Tcl's internal interfaces have
	therefore been removed, since Tcl now exports a more suitable
	public API (Tcl_FS...)
	
	* generic/tclInt.stubs:
	* generic/tclInt.h: updated for removed internal functions.
	Some new internal functions have been put in tclInt.h (and
	not exported in the stub table because good public equivalents
	exist).
	* generic/tclTest.c: some test functions used the internal private 
	APIs.  These tests have been retained, but modified to use 
	public APIs.  Also objectified the internal filesystem tests.
	* win/tclWinFile.c: removed TclpStat, TclpAccess and refactored
	code to use NativeAccess, NativeStat.  This should speed up
	stat, access and glob commands.
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: removed all TclpCopy/Rename/Delete 
	File/Directory string-based procedures which aren't used any more.
	Improved efficiency of some other procedures. Ensure that filename
	conversions with a NULL interp do not crash Tcl.
	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c: wrapped long lines and cleaned up
	TclpObjNormalizePath, removed all TclpCopy/Rename/Delete 
	File/Directory string-based procedures which aren't used any more.
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: removed obsolete TclpStat, TclpAccess, TclpChdir,
	etc.
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: removed use of TclpAccess, removed all
	TclpCopy/Rename/Delete File/Directory string-based procedures which
	aren't used any more.
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: removed obsolete TclpStat, TclpAccess, TclpChdir,
	etc.
	* tcl(Unix|Mac|Win)Chan.c: objectified TclpOpenFileChannel.
	* various 'load' implementations all objectified.
	* generic/tclFileName.c: removed redundant code.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: removed TclStat, TclAccess, TclpListVolumes.
	Fix to MatchInDirectory at the root of a volume.  Also improved
	some documentation, and improved default path joining behaviour
	for virtual filesystems, especially regarding '~'.
	* tests/fileName.test: added tests to check for bugs fixed above.
	* doc/FileName.3: improved documentation
	
2001-08-30  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclAsync.c:
	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: Improper cleanup of asyncMutex in tclAsync.c
	repaired.  TclFinalizeSynchronization() was trying to remove a
	registered mutex that was dumped earlier when the TSD it was stored
	in was cleared. This was only surfacing on *nix.  Windows was being
	masked by mutexes not actually being returned to the system!  That
	was repaired in a previous patch.  Needed to add a private
	TclFinalizeAsync() to tclAsync.c and called from Tcl_FinalizeThread().
	Pheww..  Is this done yet?
	[Bug: 414419] requested by Rob Ratcliff <rrr6399@futuretek.com>

2001-08-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclPushVarName): noted 'static' defn.
	[Bug #453872]

2001-08-26  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl (tcl_findLibrary):
	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.{1,9}):
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  Corrected 
	inconsistency between  the search path for script libraries and
	the directory name $DISTNAME into which distributions built
	by 'make test' unpack.  [Bug 455642]

2001-08-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/stringComp.test: added string-1.3
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): changed to return
	TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE instead of TCL_ERROR when compiling and an
	unknown string method is called.  This is necessary as the string
	command may be never called, or not until 'string' is redefined.

2001-08-24 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/glob.n: documented windows-style path issue with glob.
	[Bug: 219392]
	* doc/filename.n: documented windows path/file length limitation.
	[Bug: 454597]

2001-08-24  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.9): Corrected expected result
	to match Tcl's quirky construction of its init library path.

2001-08-23  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Fixed tcl Bug
	  [432499]. Part of the code used the non-absolute path to the
	  executable to determine quoting. This failed if the absolute
	  path contained spaces, but the application name itself not. This
	  bug caused no trouble on Win NT 5, but does for other variants
	  in the Win* family. Report and fix due to Ken Poole
	  <kenpoole@users.sourceforge.net>.

2001-08-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added QNX-6 build support. [Bug #219410] (loverso)

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclFileName.c: corrected minor compiler warnings.

2001-08-23 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	Variety of small filesystem and vfs issues fixed or improved.
	The new fs code allows many new opportunities for efficiency
	improvements through the objectified API. The main changes
	integrated here are such efficiency improvements.  Some
	limitations of the original implementation have also now been
	lifted.  Meanwhile a variety of fs bugs (some old, some new)
	have also been fixed.
	
	* generic/tclFileName.c: Made Tcl_FSSplitPath more efficient, 
	and removed some static string-based procedures which are no 
	longer used.  Much more objectification.  Tcl_FSJoinPath
	is now very efficient and more aware of virtual filesystems.
	Clarified where the Mac-specific code attempts to interpret
	Unix-style paths.  Modified TclDoGlob to use lstat not
	access to fix [Bug: 434876, L. Virden]
	* tcl(Win|Unix|Mac)FCmd.c:
	* tcl(Win|Unix|Mac)File.c: replaced TclpListVolumes with
	TclpObjListVolumes with different signature, updated code due
	to more efficient signature of Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath.  Used
	cached native paths where possible to improve efficiency --
	this was completed on MacOS, but on Unix and Win the traversal
	functions make the task much more complex, so there are still
	some improvements possible there.  Removed unused 
	TclpNormalizePath which had been left in tclWinFCmd.c.
	Objectified all 'file attributes' functions.  Fixed the new
	[Bug:451571, Bruce Stephens] which is most obvious on Unix, 
	but could occur on MacOS or Windows.  This bug actually existed
	in Tcl 8.3.x but was only made obvious by the recent filesystem
	overhaul when the code was exercised more heavily.  
	* tests/fileName.test: Three new tests to exercise the above bug,
	and make sure it is fixed correctly.
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: avoid panic in glob when a link
	doesn't point anywhere.  It would probably be good to define
	exactly what Tcl should do in circumstances like these, and
	make sure mac/win/unix all behave accordingly. [Bug: 417111, 
	Hemang Lavana]. Also fixed misleading/obsolete comment in the code.
	* generic/tcl.stubs: changed signature of Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath
	and added Tcl_FSGetTranslatedStringPath.
	These changes allow further optimisations in the FS code.
	* generic/tcl.h: changed signature of Tcl_FSListVolumes so that 
	it doesn't require a Tcl interpreter plus result.  Renamed 
	Tcl_FSReadLink to Tcl_FSLink with additional argument so
	we can support making links in the future. [Patch: 450340]
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	added declaration for TclpObjListVolumes.  Objectified 
	internal call signatures for 'file attributes' functions, and
	added an internal objectified get path type function.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: added the moved function TclpListVolumes 
	which calls platform specific code (needed for backwards 
	compatibility), and improved efficiency of parts of the FS
	(particularly file normalization).  Much less copying and
	memory allocation is required now.  added new GetPathType 
	so that changes in 'file volumes' can actually affect files'
	types, and objectified more code.  Made current code work
	with test suite artificially changing current platform.
	Added 'static' keywords where required.
	* generic/tclIO.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c: Added 'static' keywords, fixing 
	[Bug: 453872, Bob Techentin]
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: file command implementation updated for 
	API changes, removed unnecessary special-case SplitPath static
	function, since it no longer helps prevent code duplication.
	Moved setting of interpreter result to each individual location
	that actually required it, to avoid very large code separation
	between reading and setting the result.
	* doc/FileSystem.3: updated documentation for the new or 
	changed APIs, and clarified some issues.
	* doc/SplitPath.3: added pointer to newer APIs in FileSystem.3
	* doc/filename.n: clarified current implementation of tilde
	support on Mac/Win.  [Bug:453514, Sergey Kuzmin]
	* doc/glob.n: improved documentation for '-directory' and '-path' 
	options.
	
	There are now many private, obsolete, platform-specific 'Tclp' 
	string-based filesystem APIs which could be removed.  We should
	check whether any of these are used by extensions and, at least
	in Tcl 9, remove them.
	
	The above changes signify a ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** 
	with 8.4a3, since signatures of two functions in the new API 
	have changed, but not with older versions of Tcl.

2001-08-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (FormatNumber): Extract a long from the
	object and not an int, to stop [binary format] from being unable
	to format some input numbers on architectures where sizeof(int) is
	less than sizeof(long) (particularly Alpha.)  [tiprender Bug #441861]

	* tests/format.test: Converted conditional execution of tests into
	a test constraint.

2001-08-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: updated install target for dde1.2
	* doc/dde.n: fixed dde man page (which was totally incorrect).
	* tests/winDde.test:
	* win/tclWinDde.c (Tcl_DdeObjCmd): added -binary option to dde
	request command to allow for returning binary data. [Bug #227482]
	Updated dde to 1.2

	* tests/tcltest.test: added unixExecs constraint to files that
	used 'grep' in the test. [Bug #453143]

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: fixed stdio constraint test.
	[Patch #454050] (stanton)
	Simplified unixExecs constraint test. 
	
2001-08-22  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/ioUtil.test (ioUtil-3.*): Corrected errors in tests
	revealed by fix of overagressive compiler.  [Bug 451200]

2001-08-21  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:
	* tests/compile.test: Fixed overagressive compilation of [catch]:
	it was catching errors at substitution time. [Bug #219184]
	
2001-08-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test (tcltest-12.2): fixed test that would break
	when env vars weren't Tcl list friendly [Patch #454046] (stanton)

2001-08-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/http/http.tcl (geturl): added port number to Host:
	header to comply with HTTP/1.1 spec (RFC 2068).  [Bug #452217]

2001-08-16  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* tools/tcl.hpj.in:
	* win/tcl.hpj.in:  Removed -kb storage in CVS to ensure these text
	files are checked-out in the translation mode CVS is in.  Setting
	these as binary as part of an effort to make sure they are always
	in CRLF, no matter what the CVS translation, is bypassing how CVS
	works and is confusing.

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:  Removed LF-only output.  Having to reconvert
	back to CRLF before committing to CVS was giving me a headache.
	[Bug: 451333]

	* win/makefile.vc: replaced $(WINDIR) with $(include32) for the
	.rc.res inference rule.  winver.h wasn't getting included.
	[Bug: 445630]

2001-08-14  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: make the intial maxNestingDepth of an
	interpreter be MAX_NESTING_DEPTH instead of a hardwired value
	[Bug: 232564]

2001-08-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/trace.test: Corrected test numbers [Bug: 449794] 

2001-08-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in:

	of defining our own using_gcc variable.

2001-08-11  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

        Variety of small issues introduced by the vfs code fixed:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: uninitialised read.
	* generic/tclFCmd.c: possible memory leak in file delete 
	with error condition.

2001-08-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: 
	* tests/trace.test: Insure that [array] traces work correctly for
	undefined variables [Bug: 449094] 

2001-08-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Delete the unused getcwd.o

2001-08-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	8.4a3 RELEASE

	* changes:
	* README:
	* mac/README: 
	* unix/README:
	* win/README.binary: updated for 8.4a3 release

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_FSSplitPath): update to Tcl style
	guide.

	* generic/tclFCmd.c (FileCopyRename): fixed mem leak in
	introduction of vfs code where a new Tcl_Obj wasn't freed.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd, Tcl_RegsubObjCmd):
	reordered the retrieval of arguments to avoid shimmering bug when
	the pattern and string referenced the same object.

	* unix/configure: regenerated
	* unix/tcl.m4: added GNU (HURD) configuration target. (brinkmann)
	[Patch: #442974]

	* win/README: made note of URL for Windows compilation notes

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (TclpFinalizeMutex, TclpFinalizeCondition):
	added DeleteCriticalSection calls for cleanup [Patch: #419683]

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpCreateTempFile): fixed use of tmpnam,
	which is dangerous. [Patch: #442636] (lim)
	The use of tmpnam in TclpTempFileName must still be changed.

	* tests/http.test (http-4.14): fixed variable error return.
	[Bug: 424252]

2001-08-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure: regenerated
	* win/tcl.m4: fixed DLLSUFFIX definition to always be ${DBGX}.dll.
	This is necessary for TEA compliant builds that build shared
	against a static-built Tcl.
	* win/Makefile.in ($(TCLSH)): added $(TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE) to build
	target, otherwise it wouldn't get generated in a static build.

2001-08-06  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_GetsObjCmd): Applied patch from SF item
	  [442665] to fix the bug reported by it. The function can corrupt
	  a freed object if it is called with objc == 3. This is because
	  it retrieves resultPtr and does not increment its reference
	  count, but then calls Tcl_ObjSetVar2, which causes the retrieved
	  resultPtr object to be released.
	
2001-08-06  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tclsh.1:  Added note that the tclsh program is frequently
	installed with the Tcl version numer as part of the name.
	[Patch 402725]

	* generic/tclPkg.c:
	* tests/pkg.test:  [package forget] now forgets all of the
	package arguments it receives, not stopping when a package is
	not found.  [Bug 415273]

2001-08-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory): corrected
	uninitialized value.

2001-08-02  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* win/tclWinPort.h:
	Revert <tchar.h> related changes made to improve
	Cygwin support on 2001-07-18. This change ended
	up breaking the VC++ build because of conflicts
	between Windows APIs and internal Tk APIs.

2001-08-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: minor casts to eliminate warnings. (lim)
	[Patch: #440218]

	* tests/parseOld.test: changed some tests that required
	testwordend to exist to skip in a proper tcltest manner.
	[Bug: #442663]

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::mapReply): the regsub'ing of \n and
	\t to escape them was unnecessary.

2001-07-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (Tcl_CreateThread): Close Windows
	HANDLE returned by _beginthreadex. The MS documentation
	states that this handle is not closed by a later call to
	_endthreadex.

2001-07-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/pkgMkindex.n:
	* library/package.tcl:  Corrected documentation and usage
	message of [pkg_mkIndex].

2001-07-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: Define TCHAR by including
	windows.h instead of tchar.h since Cygwin does not
	support the tchar.h header. Include CHECK_UNICODE_CALLS
	logic from tclWinPort.h.
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Remove CHECK_UNICODE_CALLS logic.
	Remove include of windows.h since this now done it
	tclPlatDecls.h.
	* win/tclWinReg.c: Remove duplicate include of windows.h.

2001-07-18  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Aftermath to [SF #427196]. Squash empty buffers
	  if they are smaller than the requested buffersize, to prevent
	  reusage of old buffers and to honor changes in the requested
	  buffersize made by the user.

2001-07-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpReadlink): Add Cygwin specific definition
	for the TclpReadlink function. This method implements reading of
	symbolic links when build with Cygwin.

2001-07-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h: Add Cygwin specific defines for environ
	and timezone variables.

2001-07-17  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (GetInput): Fixed [SF #427196]. Memory was
	  overwritten because a buffer was used after a change of the
	  requested buffersize together with that requested buffersize and
	  not its actual size, which was smaller. Note that the continous
	  reuse of the smaller buffer negatively impacts performance. The
	  system never allocates a buffer with the newly requested bigger
	  buffersize.

2001-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: Define __WIN32__ when
	__CYGWIN__ or __MINGW32__ is defined.
	* generic/tclAlloc.c: Define caddr_t when
	compiling with VC++ or mingw. This type is
	already defined when compiling with Cygwin.

2001-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinPort.h:
	* win/tclWinSerial.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:
	Remove unnecessary #includes of dos.h, direct.h,
	and tchar.h. This will help the Cygwin porting
	effort since these headers do not exist under Cygwin.

2001-07-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (PipeClose2Proc): constrained the mutex lock to
	just the TerminateThread call and waiting for termination. (jsmith)

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Removed extra copy of the SCAN_* macros
	#defined in generic/tclScan.c. (porter) [Bug 441230]

2001-07-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.8): Added extra constraint,
	notInstalledInTmp, to stop this test from damaging installations
	in /tmp; not much fun to have to reinstall the Tcl library every
	time you run the test suite!

	* tests/subst.test (subst-10.*): Updated tests to check new
	behaviour for 'break' in command substitutions.
	(subst-1.2,subst-7.1): Error messages changed.
	* doc/SubstObj.3: New file, to document Tcl_SubstObj.
	* doc/subst.n: Improved and updated documentation for 'subst' to
	help support the changed behaviour.
	* generic/tcl.decls (generic-437): Declaration for Tcl_SubstObj
	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_SUBST_*): Added flags for Tcl_SubstObj.
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj,Tcl_SubstObjCmd): Divided into
	two parts to allow people to access the innards of 'subst' and
	changed the behaviour when command substitutions do a 'break' to
	be different from 'continue'.  Also now works with objects, which
	allows for some nifty optimisations with variable substitutions
	and a slight improvement with command substitutions.  [TIP#36]

2001-07-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add AR variable for use in STLIB_LD.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Use STLIB_LD when defining MAKE_LIB
	and MAKE_STUB_LIB. Subst RANLIB and AR.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Add doc comment about
	STLIB_LD command. Check ${AR} env var when setting
	STLIB_LD and delay evaluation until make time.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Delay evaluation of
	${AR} in STLIB_LD and add flags to better match the
	Unix implementation. Don't bother defining AR when
	using VC++ since it is not used.

2001-07-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Pass -e _WinMain@16 in
	addition to the -mwindows flag to work around a problem
	with ld when it incorrectly use main() as the executable
	entry point when both WinMain() and main() are available.

2001-07-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: Added leading zero to file modes to work
	around fault in HPUX strtol() which ignores the base parameter
	[Bug #438808]

2001-07-05  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Subst DEPARG directly instead
	of relying on a variable. This will make Cygwin
	builds faster since an extra exec will be avoided.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Subst DEPARG.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Move AC_MSG_CHECKING
	after the AC_CHECK_PROG so that status messages do
	not get mixed together. Set DEPARG based on the
	results of the cygpath check so that we avoid using
	an extra exec when it is not needed. Use ac_cv_cygwin
	status flag instead of looking at the output of
	gcc -v, which works in the case where -mno-cygwin is
	set in the CFLAGS.

2001-07-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:
	* mac/README:
	* unix/README:
	* win/README:
	* win/README.binary: updated READMEs with purls

2001-07-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Remove PATHTYPE variable.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't subst PATHTYPE.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Remove PATHTYPE
	variable. Set CYGPATH to "cygpath -w" if the
	cygpath executable is found on the path. This
	approach works for native Cygwin builds and
	cross compiles.

2001-07-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/var.test:
	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_VariableObjCmd): added patch to check for
	number of args. [Patch #426038]

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_GetVar2Ex): added ability to recognize
	TCL_TRACE_READS flags to cause creation of part1 in TclLookupVar
	to make sure newly created array will get read traces triggered
	appropriately.  This is called by Tcl_ObjGetVar2, Tcl_GetVar, and
	Tcl_GetVar2.
	(TclSetIndexedScalar, TclSetElementOfIndexedArray): added read
	trace triggering for lappend case.
	(Tcl_LappendObjCmd): pass TCL_TRACE_READS to Tcl_ObjGetVar2 to
	trigger possible read traces for new arrays.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): added TCL_TRACE_READS
	flag to INST_LAPPEND(_ARRAY)_STK case to trigger read traces for
	newly created arrays.  Removed unnecessary #ifdef for
	TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG in INST_LOAD_SCALAR1 case.

	* tests/append.test:
	* tests/appendComp.test: added tests for read trace triggering for
	append and lappend.

2001-07-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* tests/clock.test (clock-2.5): Adjust test so that it passes
	when the time slice is 60 msecs, now passes under Windows 98.

2001-07-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Don't pass the v flag
	to ${AR} when using gcc, verbose output is not needed.

2001-07-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.8):  Changed test back to using
	installation layout, adding comments explaining why the test writes
	to the directories it does, and checks to avoid destroying other
	files in /tmp.

2001-07-03  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-1.2): Fixed faults reported in
	Bug#438070 - well, at least enough to work on Solaris - and added
	comments that should make what is going on in the test clearer.

2001-07-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/util.test: added util-4.6
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_ConcatObj): Corrected walking backwards
	over utf-8 chars. [Bug #227512]

2001-07-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.8):  Corrected test for all
	absolute pathnames in library path when executable is installed
	near root directory to use correct development directory layout.
	[Bug 438014]

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.9):  
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  Corrected buggy
	construction of search path entries relative to executable.
	Added test for bad construction.  [Bug 438014]

2001-06-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c: Correction to faulty patch from [Bug: 231259] 

2001-06-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-1.2): Modified so as not to
	require a local echo service, which fails on many systems which
	have that turned off for security reasons...

2001-06-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in: added a -DPURIFY mode that makes Tcl_Obj's
	allocated and free singularly (instead of in alloc in blocks and
	never free) to allow checkers like Purify to operate better.

	* library/encoding/koi8-u.enc: added koi8-u (Ukranian variant)
	encoding.

	* tests/subst.test:
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfBackslash): Corrected backslash
	handling of multibyte utf-8 chars. [Bug #217987]

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoProcsCmd): fixed potential mem leak in
	info procs that created objects without using them.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): fixed mem leak when
	string command failed to parse the subcommand.

	* doc/interp.n:
	* doc/unknown.n: updated notes about what is in a safe interp.
	[Bug #218605]

2001-06-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/event.test (event-11.5): Removed hard-coded port number
	which could fail on some systems.  [Bug #436727]

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Add `make shell` target. This target
	will set the proper env vars before invoking tclsh
	from the build directory.

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Use : to separate VPATH entries. This
	works for both Cygwin builds and cross builds, the VPSEP
	variable is simply unneeded complexity.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't subst VPSEP.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Remove VPSEP variable.

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Fix last checkin by removing
	export since that only works in bash.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Ditto.

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Set CFLAGS to "" if the user
	did not set CFLAGS in the env. This keeps AC_PROG_CC
	from adding "-g -O2" to the CFLAGS by default.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Ditto.

2001-06-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Use RC_DEFINE flag from tcl.m4.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Set RC_DEFINE
	flag based on the compiler in use.
	
2001-06-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Link to the
	imm32 library when building with mingw gcc.

2001-06-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): When building with
	gcc, don't attempt to link with LD or support dllwrap.
	Simply require a recent version of Cygwin gcc or Mingw
	gcc that supports -shared. When linking, use gcc instead
	of ld since gcc automatically includes libs like -lmsvcrt.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add resource compiler fix from
	8.3.3 to fix compiling with mingw.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4: Fix silly typo in last checkin.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Set CFLAGS to @CFLAGS@ and @CFLAGS_DEFAULT@.
	Set LDFLAGS to @LDFLAGS@ and @LDFLAGS_DEFAULT@. Add LDFLAGS_DEBUG
	and LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE to match the way CFLAGS_DEFAULT works.
 	This will support user set CFLAGS or LDFLAGS at configure time.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Don't set CFLAGS to CFLAGS_DEFAULT, instead
	subst CFLAGS_DEFAULT into the Makefile. Add AC_SUBST for CFLAGS_DEFAULT,
	LDFLAGS_DEFAULT, LDFLAGS_DEBUG, and LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS): Modify LDFLAGS_DEFAULT so that
	it uses a Makefile variable just like CFLAGS_DEFAULT.
	* win/Makefile.in: Set CFLAGS to @CFLAGS@ and @CFLAGS_DEFAULT@.
	Set LDFLAGS to @LDFLAGS@ and @LDFLAGS_DEFAULT@.
	This will support user set CFLAGS or LDFLAGS at configure time.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't set CFLAGS or LDFLAGS, instead subst
	CFLAGS_DEFAULT and LDFLAGS_DEFAULT into the Makefile.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS): Modify LDFLAGS_DEFAULT so that
	it uses a Makefile variable just like CFLAGS_DEFAULT.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Don't set LDFLAGS_DEBUG
	to -g or LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE to -O when compiling with gcc.
	These flags are not needed and can cause problems with
	the Cygwin version of ld.

2001-06-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-1.2,unixInit-2.8): Added test for
	code described below, and fixed a couple of errors that caused
	problems during testing; the code to determine the installedTcl
	constraint was wrong, and test unixInit-2.8 assumed that /tmp/lib
	was free for use and could be deleted, which clashed nastily with
	my installation and made other tests fail unnecessarily!

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TtyInit,TclpOpenFileChannel,
	Tcl_MakeFileChannel,TclpGetDefaultStdChannel): Alterations so that
	the standard channels - stdin, stdout and stderr - have the
	correct type and fconfigure options.  This required making the
	initialisation of serial lines a little more sophisticated to
	make the console behave correctly in interactive mode... [Bug
	#219137 and duplicates]

2001-06-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* generic/tclPanic.c (Tcl_PanicVA):
	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c (main):
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c (TclpPanic):
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Replaced TclMacSetPanic with TclpPanic
	for setting a platform-specific panic handler.  TclpPanic
	is NULL on Unix and Windows.  Fixes broken wish on Mac due
	to earlier patches.  [Patch 415648]
	
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: `make gentubs` after above changes.

2001-06-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c (main, Macintosh_Init):
	* mac/tclMacBOAAppInit.c (main):
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c: Applied patches from Dan Steffen correcting
	problems on the Macintosh in the 2001-06-08 changes.

2001-06-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/regexp.test (regexp-18.12): 
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd): Fixed so that submatches
	that do not match always have index pair {-1 -1} [Bug #219232]

2001-06-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclPanic.c: Added CONST to Tcl_*Panic* public interfaces.
	[Patch 415648, TIP 27]

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c (main):
	* mac/tclMacBOAAppInit.c (main):
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c: Modified special Mac implementations of
	Tcl_*Panic* to be exact copies of the generic implementations.
	Added TclMacSetPanic.  The generic implementations should be
	used directly, rather than copies, but that requires further
	changes by someone familiar with the Mac build systems.
	[Patch 415648]

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: `make gentubs` after above changes.

	* doc/Panic.3:
	* unix/mkLinks:  New file documenting Tcl_*Panic* public interfaces,
	followed by `make mklinks`.  [Patch 415648, Bug 219170, Bug 414936]

2001-06-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_DStringAppendElement): patch to save an
	extra strlen call.  [Bug #428572]

2001-05-30  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Added two casts to
	INST_STR_CMP implementation to get rid of a couple warnings from
	the SUNWspro C compiler.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_GetMathFuncInfo,Tcl_ListMathFuncs): 
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_InfoObjCmd,InfoFunctionsCmd): 
	* generic/tcl.decls (generic table, positions 435+436): 
	* tests/info.test: 
	* doc/CrtMathFnc.3: 
	* doc/info.n: Changes due to TIP #15 "Functions to List and Detail
	Math Functions"

2001-05-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/init.tcl (unknown): removed errant " in error message

2001-05-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/regc_locale.c: updated character class range data for
	Unicode v3.1.0 compliance.
	* generic/tclUniData.c: regenerated from Unicode v3.1.0 data file
	(new as of 2001-05-16).  This brings Tcl to current unicode
	compliance.

	* tests/utf.test: added tests to check unicode 3 compliance

	* unix/Makefile.in (tclUtf.o): added tclUniData.c dependency.

	* tools/uniClass.tcl: added comments to output format and the
	script for clarification.

	* tools/uniParse.tcl: corrected filename output and GetDelta macro
	to use 'info' as param (was 'infO')

2001-05-26  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclVar.c (tclArraySearchType,SetArraySearchObj,
	ParseSearchId): Added code to speed up array searching by reducing
	the amount of parsing needed for searchIds.

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclInitObjSubsystem): 
	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct): 
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (TclInitNamespaceSubsystem): 
	* generic/tclInt.h: Moved some Tcl_ObjType initialisation to
	TclInitObjSubsystem to be with the bulk of the rest.
	[Patch 424851] Committed by Miguel Sofer <mig@utdt.edu>

2001-05-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/io.test: changed io-52.[9-11] to not be platform sensitive
	with EOL translation.

2001-05-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG): Fix comments,
	and typo in cached variable name.

2001-05-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_LOAD_TKCONFIG):
	Remove use of undefined TCLCONFIG variable and
	call AC_MSG_RESULT to print the checking result.
	* win/tcl.m4: Ditto.

2001-05-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclAllocateFreeObjects): simplified
	objSizePlusPadding to use sizeof(Tcl_Obj) (max)
	Corrected use of tclObjsAlloced/Freed/Shared in TCL_MEM_DEBUG
	compile.

2001-05-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: removed Tcl_DuplicateObj in INST_DUP 

2001-05-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test (tcltest-19.1): fixed failing test that was
	getting affected by Windows env handling of empty valued elements.

	* unix/tcl.m4: added more common install directories in which to
	search for *Config.sh [Bug #419812]

	* tests/cmdMZ.test (cmdMZ-1.4): added notLinux constraint to test
	to prevent failure message on Linux due to OS caching bug.

	* tests/httpd (httpdRespond): added response to timeout value in
	query string.

	* tests/http.test: removed unused notLinux constraint setting

	* generic/tclRegexp.c (Tcl_RegExpExecObj): added use of
	Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj.

2001-05-19  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Note that "tclbench" (see project "tcllib") was extended with
	  performance benchmarks for [fcopy] too.

	* doc/fcopy.n: Updated to reflect the extended behaviour of 'fcopy'.

	* tests/io.test: Added tests 'io-52.9', 'io-52.10' and 'io-52.11'
	  to test the handling of encodings by 'fcopy' / 'TclCopychannel'
	  [Bug #209210].

	* generic/tclIO.c: Split of both 'Tcl_ReadChars' and
	  'Tcl_WriteChars' into a public error checking and an internal
	  working part. The public functions now use the new internal
	  ones. The new functions are 'DoReadChars' and 'DoWriteChars'.
	  Extended 'CopyData' to use the new functions 'DoXChars' when
	  required by the encodings on the input and output channels
	  [Bug #209210].

2001-05-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/history.tcl (tcl::HistAdd): prevent empty calls from
	being added to the history (arndt)

	* tests/error.test: updated error-1.3 message to account for
	string index being compiled at toplevel.
	* tests/appendComp.test:
	* tests/stringComp.test: new files for extended bytecode testing

	* generic/tclBasic.c: added new CompileProc invocations to basic
	command initialization.
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: added new compile commands for append,
	lappend, lindex and llength.  Refactored set and incr compile
	commands to use new TclPushVarName function for handling the
	varname component during compilation (also used by append and
	lappend).  Changed string compile command to compile toplevel code
	as well (when possible).
	* generic/tclCompile.c: added new instruction enums
	* generic/tclCompile.h: added debug info for new instructions
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): moved elemPtr to
	toplevel var (oft-used).  Added definitions for new bytecode
	instructions INST_LIST_INDEX, INST_LIST_LENGTH, INST_APPEND_SCALAR1,
	INST_APPEND_SCALAR4, INST_APPEND_ARRAY1, INST_APPEND_ARRAY4,
	INST_APPEND_ARRAY_STK, INST_APPEND_STK, INST_LAPPEND_SCALAR1,
	INST_LAPPEND_SCALAR4, INST_LAPPEND_ARRAY1, INST_LAPPEND_ARRAY4,
	INST_LAPPEND_ARRAY_STK, INST_LAPPEND_STK.
	Refactored repititious code for reuse with INST_LOAD_STK (same as
	INST_LOAD_SCALAR_STK), INST_STORE_STK (same as
	INST_STORE_SCALAR_STK).
	Updated INST_STR_CMP with style of fix of 2001-04-06 Fellows
	[Bug #219201] as that fix only affected the runtime eval'ed
	"string" (string compare is normally byte-compiled now).  We
	may want to back these out for speed in the future, noting the
	problems with \x00 comparisons in the docs.
	* generic/tclInt.h: declarations for new compile commands.
	* generic/tclVar.c: change TclGetIndexedScalar,
	TclGetElementOfIndexedArray, TclSetElementOfIndexedArray and
	TclSetIndexedScalar to use flags.  The Set functions now support
	TCL_APPEND_ELEMENT and TCL_LIST_ELEMENT as well.
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: minor signature changes for above.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: made use of new Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj.

2001-05-16  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/console.n: Deleted.  Put it in the wrong source tree!  D'oh!

2001-05-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj): new function to
	parallel Tcl_GetStringFromObj (fix of an API oversight).

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c: updated pipeChannelType to
	TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2 type specification.

	* tests/fileName.test: corrected tests not to fail on win when a
	C:/test dir exists.

	* generic/tclFileName.c (ExtractWinRoot): corrected ABR error

2001-05-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/lindex.test: added test for nested braces [Patch: 423617]

2001-05-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h
	* generic/tclNamesp.c: invalidate all bytecodes in a namespace if
	a new command shadows a bytecoded command.
	* tests/namespace.test
	Patched from [Bug: 231259] 

2001-05-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/console.n: Created.  It seems very odd to me that the
	console implementation is part of the Tcl distribution and not
	part of Tk, but given the location of the source, the
	documentation must obviously match up...

2001-05-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): 
	* tests/string.test (string-4.14): Negative string indices should
	not be added as offsets to the result of [string first] but
	instead be treated as referring to the start of the string.
	[Bug: 423581]

2001-05-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add a LDFLAGS variable to the
	Makefile instead of directly substing @LDFLAGS@.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Fix CFLAGS_DEFAULT so that the name
	of a Makefile variable is passed as @CFLAGS@.
	* win/Makefile.in: Move the setting of CFLAGS
	higher up in the Makefile.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Use dnl to comment out macros
	so that they are not accidently expanded.

2001-05-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/library.n:
	* library/init.tcl:
	* tests/autoMkindex.t*: Modified [auto_import] to apply
	pattern matching in the [namespace import] style.  [Bug 420186]
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for any callers of [auto_import]
	from outside Tcl that expect the pattern matching to be like that
	of [string match].

2001-05-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c: 
	* tests/namespace.test: Insure consistent behaviour of the
	[unknown] command: when a command is unknown, it is always
	processed by [::unknown], ignoring any namespace proc which
	happens to be called "unknown" [Patch #421166, Bug #420507]

2001-05-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Add a package require of Tcl 8
	at the beginning of the script so that the script
	will print a descriptive error message when run
	in an old Tcl 7 shell.

2001-04-27  Kevin Kenny	<kennykb@crd.ge.com>

	commands instead of using a delayed subst variable. Replace
	instances of STUB_LIB_FILE with TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE.

2001-04-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Use TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE instead of STUB_LIB_FILE.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Don't subst STUB_LIB_FILE, use TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE
	instead.

2001-04-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tools/encoding/iso8859-15.txt:
	* library/encoding/iso8859-15.enc: Oops! Got the full encoding
	wrong.  Should be fixed now...

	* tools/encoding/iso8859-15.txt:
	* library/encoding/iso8859-15.enc:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in: Added ISO 8859-15 (a.k.a. Latin-1 + Euro
	currency symbol) support.

	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclRenameCommand): Missing CONST from

	[Patch #415179]
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** from 8.4a2, in which Vince
	Darley's changes to command tracing were added.  A const has been
	added to the type signature of one of the parameters to
	Tcl_CommandTraceProc.

2001-04-10  Kevin B. Kenny    <kennykb@acm.org>
	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: Altered code to use memcpy instead of
	structure assigments in an effort to achieve better K&R
	compatibility.
	
2001-04-10  Kevin B. Kenny    <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: Fixed silly typo in calls to 'gmtime' and
	'localtime' that broke the Linux build.

2001-04-09  Kevin B. Kenny    <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tclLoadShl.c: Added DYNAMIC_PATH to the load flags so that
	the SHLIB_PATH will be searched for other libraries.  [Bug #219140]
	
2001-04-09  Kevin B. Kenny    <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tcl.m4: Added _REENTRANT to Solaris build so that thread

2001-04-09  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/expr.test (expr-21.*): Tests to check below fix.
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (GetLexeme): Now recognises the
	non-numeric boolean literals for what they are. It no longer makes
	sense for anyone to create functions with the same name as one of
	them, but this was true in 7.* as well [Bug #217777; finally!]

2001-04-07  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd, STR_COMPARE branch): Fixed
	problem caused by Utf-rep of \x00 being more than Utf-rep of \x01
	fooling memcmp by forcing everything through Utf-based
	comparisons.  Added optimizations for case where objects have a
	string/unicode-rep or a bytearray-rep (i.e. where we can perform
	comparisons on fixed-size units.) [Bug #219201]
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfNcmp): Corrected seriously erroneous
	comment.

2001-04-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-03-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All of the changes below belong to TIP #10 [Tcl I/O Enhancement:
	  Thread-Aware Channels]. See also [Patch #403358] at SF.

	* generic/tclIO.h (struct ChannelState, line 236f): Extended the
 	  structure with a new field of type 'Tcl_ThreadId' to hold the id
 	  of the thread currently managing all channels with this state.

	  Note: This structure is shared by all channels in a stack of
 	  transformations.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_CreateChannel, lines 1058-1065): Modified
 	  to store the Id of the current thread in the 'ChannelState' of
 	  the new channel.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SpliceChannel, lines 2265-2270): Modified
 	  in the same manner as 'Tcl_CreateChannel' as the channel will be
 	  managed by the current thread afterward.

	* generic/tclIO.c   (Tcl_GetChannelThread, lines 1478-1503):
	* generic/tcl.decls (Tcl_GetChannelThread, lines 1504-1506): New
 	  API function to retrieve the Id of the managing thread from a
 	  channel. Implementation and declaration.

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestChannelCmd, lines 4520-4532): Added
 	  subcommand 'mthread' to query a channel about its managing
 	  thread.

2001-03-29  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* tests/interp.test: Print out warning when
	testinterpdelete command is not defined.
	Add tests that checks to make sure a
	child interp inherits the parent's cwd.

2001-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@gimlet.activestate.com>

	* doc/tcltest.n: corrected incorrect macro usage.

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: corrected IRIX-5.x config to not use -n32.
 	(english) [Patch #403626]

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (Tcl_ConditionWait): fixed handling of
	timeout for threads (corrects excessive CPU usage issue for Tk on
	Unix in threaded Tcl environment). (ruppert) [Bug #411603]

2001-03-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsort.n: Added some notes that clarify the behaviour of
	[lsort] as well as a whole bunch of examples.  [Bug #219202]

2001-03-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@gimlet.activestate.com>

	char *'s, not ints. [Bug #411388]

	* tests/regexp.test (regexp-19.1):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): fixed handling of nulls
	in subspec value.

2001-03-26  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclDecls.h (Tcl_InitCustomHashTable):  Correction to

	'make genstubs'.

2001-03-26  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinInt.h (tclWinTCharEncoding): Removed as now a static
	variable in win/tclWin32Dll.c instead.

 	(lavana) [Patch #403755]

2001-03-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/set-old.test (set-old-7.2): Changed error behaviour of
	[unset] to agree with documentation, so must change test as well.

2001-03-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl (pkg_mkIndex):  Added patch from Vince
	Darley to make [pkg_mkIndex -verbose] even more verbose.
	[Bug 219349, Patch 403529]

2001-03-13  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/info.n: Improved documentation for [info hostname].
	[Bug #403840]

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_UnsetObjCmd): Made command behave as
	documented [issue remaining from bug #405769]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): A missing
	{return TCL_OK;} was causing memory corruption.  [Bug #408002]

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclDeleteExecEnv, GrowEvaluationStack,
	TclExecuteByteCode): Added some casts to ClientData that are
	apparently needed on some architectures.

2001-03-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/string.test: Fixed some test numberings and added a test.
	[Patch #403229]

2001-03-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_UnsetObjCmd): Rewrote argument parser to
	avoid a read off the end of the argument array that could occur
	when executing something like [unset -nocomplain] was executed.
	Improved the error message given when too few arguments are given
	(-nocomplain should obviously be *before* --, not after it) and
	also modified the test suite to take account of that and the
	documentation to use the same improvement. [Bug 405769]

2001-03-02  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Fixed bug that could
	pass pointers to freed memory to command implementations, which
	most obviously caused some weird behaviour with [info level], but
	could have caused problems with user code and command traces too.
	[Bug 404865, Patch 405436]

2001-02-23  msofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* no changes; fixing up the missing comment in the previous one.
	Sorry.

2001-02-23  msofer  <msofer@ant.utdt>

	* /cvsroot/tcl/tcl/tests/execute.test:
	added test for evaluation of an expression in a variable; evals once
	by compiling, second time using the previous compilation

2001-02-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/clock.n: Updated documentation to reflect the addition of
	compat/strftime.c, including the correct formatting of
	ISO-8601:1988 fiscal week number (%V).
	
2001-02-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SplitObjCmd): Improved efficiency of
	splitting strings into individual characters by adding hash so
	that only one Tcl_Obj per character is created.  Improves
	performance of splitting of short strings and makes a huge
	difference to splitting of long strings, such as is done in the
	mime package in tcllib.  [Bug #131523]

2001-01-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc (install-libraries):  Corrected misdirected
	install directory for the msgcat 1.2 package.

2001-01-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): Moved code that updates the count
	of how many bytes are left to copy.  Corrects bug that when
	writing occurs in the background, the copy loop could be
	escaped without updating the count, causing CopyData() to try
	to copy more bytes than the toRead value originally passed to
	TclCopyChannel(), leading to hangs and misreporting of number
	of bytes copied. [Bug 118203, Patch 103432]

2001-01-18  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Everything below belongs together, it fixes bug #123153.

	* generic/tcl.h (line 342): A bit more explanation about the
	  default value for TCL_PRESERVE_BINARY_COMPATABILITY.

	* generic/tcl.h (line 1208): Define the macro 'Tcl_InitHashTable'
	  only when TCL_PRESERVE_BINARY_COMPATIBILITY is not set
	  as it kills binary compatibility to 8.3 and earlier
	  versions. This is the main part of the patch/change.

	* generic/tcl.decls (line 1469):
	* generic/tclHash.c (Tcl_InitHashTable):
	* generic/tclHash.c (Tcl_InitHashTableEx):
	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_InitObjHashTable): Changed
	  'Tcl_InitHashTableEx' to 'Tcl_InitCustomHashTable'. This change
	  is more of an estethical nature, replacing the ubiquitous 'Ex'
	  suffix with a more meaningful name. The introduced binary
	  incompatibility is deemed acceptable as it is between alpha
	  versions.  Updated callers.

	* doc/Hash.3:
	* unix/mkLinks: Changed 'Tcl_InitHashTableEx' to
	  'Tcl_InitCustomHashTable'.

2001-01-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/winPipe.test (winpipe-1.20): 
	* tests/winDde.test (createChildProcess): 
	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test (pkgtest::createIndex):  Removed
	assumption that paths contain no spaces which causes problems with
	both [eval] and [open |...] due to the well-known differences
	between lists and strings.  Fixes bug #119406

	* tests/unixInit.test:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  Several entries in
	the library path ($tcl_libPath) are determined relative to the
	absolute path of the executable.  When the executable is
	installed in or near the root directory of the file system,
	relative pathnames were being incorrectly generated, and in
	the worst case, memory access violations were crashing the program.
