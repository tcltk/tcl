2002-02-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TclpOpenFileChannel): Added code to regonize
	  "/dev/tty" (by name) and to not handle it as tty / serial
	  line. This is the controlling terminal and is special. Setting
	  it into raw mode as is done for other tty's is a bad idea. This
	  is a hackish fix for expect SGF Bug #520624.

2002-02-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Changed to recognize the
	  option "-error". Essentially ignores the option, always
	  returning an empty string.

2002-02-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinNotify.c (Tcl_FinalizeNotifier): backported fix for
	  [Bug #217982] which also affected Tkinter [Python Bug #216289]

2002-02-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c: updated to use Mac OS X 10.1 dyld APIs that     
	  have more libdl-like semantics. (bug #514392)

2002-02-19  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: reversed the order of 8.3.3 changes.

2002-02-15  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: First draft of Tcl changes for 8.3.5 release.

2002-02-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/scan.test:
	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): corrected scan 0x... %x
	  handling that didn't accept the 0x as a prelude to a base 16
	  number.	 [Bug #495213]

2002-02-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (FileOutputProc): Fixed [bug 465765] reported
	  by Dale Talcott <daletalcott@users.sourceforge.net>. Avoid
	  writing nothing into a file as STREAM based implementations will
	  consider this a EOF (if the file is a pipe). Not done in the
	  generic layer as this type of writing is actually useful to
	  check the state of a socket.

2002-02-05  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl:
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:  Corrected use of http::error when
	::error was intended.  Bump to http 2.4.2.

2002-02-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: io-39.22 split into two tests, one platform
	  dependent, the other not. -eofchar is not empty on the windows
	  platform.

2002-01-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Make -eofchar and -translation options read only for
	server sockets. [Bug 496733]

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_GetChannelOption, Tcl_SetChannelOption):
	Instead of returning nothing for the -translation option
	on a server socket, always return "auto". Return the empty
	string enclosed in quotes for the -eofchar option on
	a server socket. Fixup -eofchar usage message so that
	it matches the implementation.
	* tests/io.test: Add -eofchar tests and -translation tests
	to ensure options are read only on server sockets.
	* tests/socket.test: Update tests to account for -eofchar
	and -translation option changes.

2002-01-24  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/http/http.tcl: don't add port in default case to handle
	broken servers.	 http bumped to 2.4.1  [Bug #504508]

2002-01-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteChars): Fix for SF #506297, reported by
	  Martin Forssen <ruric@users.sourceforge.net>. The encoding
	  chosen in the script exposing the bug writes out three intro
	  characters when TCL_ENCODING_START is set, but does not consume
	  any input as TCL_ENCODING_END is cleared. As some output was
	  generated the enclosing loop calls UtfToExternal again, again
	  with START set. Three more characters in the out and still no
	  use of input ... To break this infinite loop we remove
	  TCL_ENCODING_START from the set of flags after the first call
	  (no condition is required, the later calls remove an unset flag,
	  which is a no-op). This causes the subsequent calls to
	  UtfToExternal to consume and convert the actual input.

2002-01-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_GetsObjCmd): Fixed bug #504642 as
	  reported by Brian Griffin <bgriffin@users.sourceforge.net>,
	  using his patch. Before the patch the generic I/O layer held an
	  unannounced reference to the interp result to store the read
	  line into. This unfortunately has disastrous results if the
	  channel driver executes a tcl script to perform its operation,
	  this freeing the interp result. In that case we are
	  dereferencing essentially a dangling reference. It is not truly
	  dangling because the object is in the free list, but this only
	  causes us to smash the free list and have the error occur later
	  somewhere else. The patch simply creates a new object for the
	  line and later sets it into the interp result when we are done
	  with reading.

2001-12-28  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/init.tcl (auto_execok): make sure env(COMSPEC) on
	Windows is executed with the right case, as it may otherwise fail
	inexplicably.

2001-12-21  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: fixed incorrect SHLIB_LD_LIBS
	setting for MacOSX / Darwin.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/mkLinks.tcl: improved case-insensitive
	filesystem support.
	* unix/mkLinks: Regen.

	* tests/namespace.test: backporting patch for [Bug 231259]

2001-11-20  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TimeObjCmd) Added extra parentheses to a
	cast expression to remove ambiguity and conform with Tcl
	Engineering Manual. [Suggestion by Donal Fellows in commentary on
	patch #483500]
	
2001-11-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TimeObjCmd): Corrected bug in [time]

2001-11-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* generic/tclIO.c (ReadChars): Fixed bug #478856 reported by
	  Stuart Cassoff <stwo@users.sourceforge.net>. The bug caused loss
	  of fileevents when [read]ing less data from the channel than
	  buffered. Due to an empty input buffer the flag
	  CHANNEL_NEED_MORE_DATA was set but never reset, causing the I/O
	  system to wait for more data instead of using a timer to
	  synthesize fileevents and to flush the pending data out of the
	  buffers.

2001-10-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	************************

	* mac/tclMacTime.c:
	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls: 
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: timezone support for mac via 
	TclpGetTZName() like on windows, using an inverse timezone table
	adapted from tclDate.c to map gmtoffset in seconds gotten from
	the MacOS APIs to a  timezone string, as there is no good way to get
	this info from MacOS. I had to make up some unusual timezones and
	arbitrarily decide on the most standard of the multiple choices

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclDate.c:
	* generic/tclGetDate.y:
	* mac/tclMacInt.h:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: default mac epoch changed to standard unix

	* mac/tclMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tclMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.r:
	* mac/tclMacResource.r: updated copyrights/dates in version
	strings; reorganized resources among these files to avoid 
	multiple copies in applications and shared libraries, the script
	libraries are now no longer duplicated in Tclsh but are only  
	included in the resources of Tcl.shlb.

	* tests/cmdMZ.test:
	* tests/exec.test:
	* tests/fileName.test: added missing cleanups/tests/catches that
	caused tests to fail on the mac.

	* doc/tclvars.n: documentation error, env(PWD) should be env(HOME)

	  case (needed for MacOSX/Darwin on HFS+ FS)

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c: change in binary extension format from 
	  MachO bundles to standard .dylib dynamic libraries like on
	  other unices. **POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** extensions
	  will have to be recompiled as .dylib's. 
	  Improved error handling and use of DStrings and 
	  Tcl_UtfToExternalDString instead of sprintf to build up
	  symbol and library names. [Patch 435258]

2001-10-16  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls (TclExpandCodeArray,TclGetInstructionTable):
	  Added to internal stubs table. Tclcompiler (Tclpro project)
	  needs them if used as loadable package under Windows. Changed
	  signatures. We don't want to describe compiler internal
	  structures in "tclInt.h".

	* generic/tclCompile.h: S.a. Removed function declarations.

2001-09-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* generic/tclIO.c: added (on behalf of Kevin Kenny
	  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>) two more '(ClientData)' casts
	  on calls to Tcl_Preserve and Tcl_Release -- ones that Vince
	  apparently missed.
	
2001-09-27  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (ChannelTimerProc):  Added Tcl_Preserve()
	and Tcl_Release() to fix segfault introduced by the 2001-09-26
	changes.  [Bug 465494]

	* doc/TCL_MEM_DEBUG.3:	Updated out-of-date reference to
	#define GUARD_SIZE.

2001-09-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net> 

	* The changes below fix [Bug #462317] where Expect tried to read
	  more than was in the buffers and then blocked in the OS call as
	  its pty channel driver provides no blockmodeproc through which
	  the OS could be notified of blocking-behaviour. Because of this
	  the general I/O core has to take more care than usual to
	  preserve the semantics of non-blocking channels.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ReadRaw): Do not read from the driver if
	  the channel is non-blocking and the fileevent causing the read
	  was generated by a timer. We do not know if there is data
	  available from the OS. Instead of going to the OS for more and
	  potentially blocking we simply signal EWOULDBLOCK to the higher
	  levels to cause the system to wait for true fileevents.
	  (GetInput): Same as before.
	  (ChannelTimerProc): Added set and clear of CHANNEL_TIMER_FEV.

	* generic/tclIO.h (CHANNEL_TIMER_FEV): New flag for channels. Is
	  set if a fileevent was generated by a timer, the channel is not
	  blocking and the driver did not provide a blockmodeproc. In that
	  case the I/O core has to be especially careful about going to
	  the driver for more data.

2001-09-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* The change below fixes [Bug #464380]. The bug was reported by
	  Ronnie Brunner <rbrunner@users.sourceforge.net>. He also
	  provided the patch.
	
	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Moved release of
	  'tclLibraryPath' to Tcl_FinalizeThread.
	  (Tcl_FinalizeThread): See above, new place for release of
	  'tclLibraryPath'.

2001-09-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: updated IA64 compile settings

	* win/tclWinInit.c: added extra processor definitions. (mstacy)

	* win/tclWinSock.c (SocketThread): corrected pointer cast for _WIN64.

	* win/tclWinNotify.c: removed unnecessary winsock include (it is
	  already in from tclWinPort.h).

	* win/tclWinPort.h: changed winsock.h include to winsock2.h.
	  Reverses change from 2000-11-16, but is necessary for WIN64.
	  Extensions should comply with defined OS words, or use #ifndef.

2001-09-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestcmdtokenCmd): corrected pointer
	  storage/retrieval for 64bit machines.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd):
	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): corrected handling of format
	  and scan on 64-bit machines. [Bug 219223, Patch #412696] (rmax)

	* unix/configure: regen'ed
	* unix/tcl.m4: added --enable-64bit support for HP-11 with the
	  64-bit kernel.

	* generic/tcl.h: removed forced #define USE_TCLALLOC 1 for
	  Windows.  This means the native system allocator will be used by
	  default.  This should be binary and source compatible with
	  extensions, as Tcl_Alloc is a properly stubbed function.

2001-09-18  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): On Linux, disable inlining when
	  one of the compat/*.c routines is to be linked in. [Patch 440891]

2001-09-13  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfPrev): corrected to return the proper
	location when the middle of a UTF-8 byte was passed in.
	[Tk Bug #450504]

2001-09-13  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/ioCmd.test: Changed the computation of the result for
	  iocmd-8.1[123] so that the tests work for single- and
	  multi-process execution of the testsuite. Depending on the
	  choice of the user stdout is a tty or not and thus reports
	  different channel options. Fixes [460993] reported by Don
	  Porter.

2001-09-12  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	Backport several bug fixes from HEAD to core-8-3-1-branch:

	* tests/rename.test:
	* tests/split.test:  Corrected tests to better isolate tests in
	one file from influencing tests in other files.	 [Bug 460591]

	* unix/tclLoadShl.c:  Added #include of tclInt.h; access to Tcl
        internals, notably TclpUnloadFile(), is required.  Thanks to
        Bob Techentin for report and patch.  [Bug 459305]

	* generic/tclInitScript.h (initScript):
        * win/tclWinInit.c (TCL_REGISTRY_KEY, TclpSetVariables):  Removed
        vestiges of Tcl's old initialization from registry variables.
        [Bug 455645]

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-3.2): Updated test to support
        newer HP-UX releases that properly report euc-jp as the system
        encoding for Japanese.  Bug report and patch verification by Bob
        Techentin.  [Bug 453883]

	* compat/strtod.c (strtod):  Fixed failure to handle expressions
        like 3eq2 and failure to set errno on overflow.  [Bug 440894]

2001-09-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (TclInExit): Corrected handling of tsd in
	late stages of finalization.  [Bug #419449] (darley)

	* tests/stack.test:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (AliasObjCmd): Check the numLevels to ensure
	that we aren't hitting some alias loop condition.  [Bug #443184]

2001-09-10  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Added 'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels' to
	  the internal platform specific stub table.

2001-09-06  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All the changes below serve to fix bug [219148] which reports a
	  80x performance hit for file I/O on Win* systems. On my system
	  it was closer to a 120x hit. Problem report by Uwe Traum <no
	  email address available>.

	  The fix goes like this: The obstacle is 'FlushFileBuffers',
	  executed whenever Tcl writes data to the OS, as Tcl has to wait
	  for the disk to complete I/O, and disks are slow. We remove that
	  obstacle. This opens another problem, [file size] reports back
	  wrong numbers. So for [file size] we add the call back in. As
	  optimization we keep track of the channels which were written to
	  and flush only these.

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpObjStat): Added a call to
	  'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels'. This ensures that [file size] and
	  related commands report the correct size of a file even if Tcl
	  has recently written to it. Unixoid OS's always report the
	  correct size even for files with pending data, but Win*
	  syssystem don't. They only report what is actually on disk.

	* win/tclWinInt.h: Added declaration of
	  'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels', making it available to other parts
	  of the tcl core.

	* win/tclWinChan.c (TclWinFlushDirtyChannels): New, internal,
	  procedure. Goes through the list of open file channels and
	  forces the OS to flush its file buffers for all which were
	  written to since the last call of this function. This is an
	  expensive operation as Tcl has to wait for the OS to complete
	  actual writes to the disk.

	  (FileInfo): Added dirty flag required by the procedure above.

	  (FileOutputProc): Removed flushing of file buffers, setting the
	  dirty flag instead. This means that the previously incurred
	  delays do not happen anymore.

	  (TclWinOpenFileChannel): Added initialization of 'dirty' flag.

2001-09-06  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/http.n:
	* library/http/*.tcl:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* tools/tclmin.wse:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/{Mm}akefile.*:  Updated http package to version 2.4,
	  reflecting the new features just added.

2001-09-06  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/http.n: noted -binary, charset and coding state keys.
	* tests/http.test:
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/http/http.tcl (geturl): correctly get charset parameter
	  and convert text according to specified encoding (if known).
	  RFC iso8859-1 is used by default.  Also recognize
	  Content-encoding to see if we should do binary translation.
	  Added a CYA -binary switch for the cases that were missed. [Bug
	  #219211 #219399]

	* tests/ioUtil.test: changed to make better use of constraints and
	  remove knownBug constraints that weren't valid.

2001-09-01  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	-=[ Tcl_Async* API merge from HEAD ]=-

	* generic/tclInt.decls:  Removed TclpAsyncMark permanently and left
	the hole not to upset the positions.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:  regen'd tables.

	* generic/tclAsync.c: Brought source to match -r1.6 on the HEAD
	branch.

	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: Added prototype to and use of new
	TclFinalizeAsync() found in tclAsync.c.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* mac/tclMacPort.h: removed #defines for TclpAsyncMark.

	* win/tclWinInit.c: Removed the TclpAsyncMark function and the
	thread ID saving that was going on in TclpInitPlatform(). [the old
	hack]

	* win/tclWinThread.c: TclpFinalizeCondition() and
	TclpFinalizeMutex() are now properly returning the old
	CriticalSection handle to the system.  Tcl_CreateThread() is now
	decrementing its handle reference, so the system will recover
	resources when the thread closes (doh!).  These changes are all
	already up on the HEAD.

	* doc/Async.3:  matches HEAD.

2001-08-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c: fixed some casting problems that upset
	Crays. [Bug #419528] (andreasen)

	* tests/httpd (httpdRespond): added response to timeout value in
	query string.

2001-08-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Silence warning from Sun compiler. [Bug 454374]

2001-08-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/Encoding.3: added note that tclPlatDecls.h must be included
	for use of Tcl_WinTCharToUtf and Tcl_WinUtfToTChar.

	* doc/Tcl_Main.3: added docs for Tcl_SetMainLoop

	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: added Tcl_SetMainLoop proc that allows people
	to set a main loop that will run for tclsh.
	* generic/tcl.h: added Tcl_MainLoopProc typedef
	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_SetMainLoop, StdinProc, Prompt): new
	StdinProc and Prompt static procs and Tcl_SetMainLoop stubs proc.
	The first two handle a fileevent based prompt (taken from
	tkMain.c).  Tcl_SetMainLoop enables the interactive setting of a
	main loop procedure.  This enables Tk to be a loadable package.

2001-08-24  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.9): Corrected expected result
	to match Tcl's quirky construction of its init library path.

	* tests/ioUtil.test (ioUtil-3.*): Corrected errors in tests
	revealed by fix of overagressive compiler.  [Bug 451200]

	* doc/tclsh.1:	Added note that the tclsh program is frequently
	installed with the Tcl version numer as part of the name.
	[Patch 402725]

	* generic/tclPkg.c:
	* tests/pkg.test:  [package forget] now forgets all of the
	package arguments it receives, not stopping when a package is
	not found.  [Bug 415273]

	* doc/pkgMkindex.n:
	* library/package.tcl:	Corrected documentation and usage
	message of [pkg_mkIndex].

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.8): Added extra constraint,
	notInstalledInTmp, to stop this test from damaging installations
	in /tmp; not much fun to have to reinstall the Tcl library every
	time you run the test suite!

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.9):
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  Corrected buggy
	construction of search path entries relative to executable.
	Added test for bad construction.  [Bug 438014]

	* tests/cmdMZ.test (cmdMZ-1.4): added notLinux constraint to test
	to prevent failure message on Linux due to OS caching bug.

	* doc/library.n:  
	* library/init.tcl:
	* tests/autoMkindex.t*: Modified [auto_import] to apply
	pattern matching in the [namespace import] style.  [Bug 420186]
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for any callers of [auto_import]
	from outside Tcl that expect the pattern matching to be like that
	of [string match].

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Add a package require of Tcl 8
	at the beginning of the script so that the script
	will print a descriptive error message when run
	in an old Tcl 7 shell.

2001-08-23  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Fixed tcl Bug
	  [432499]. Part of the code used the non-absolute path to the
	  executable to determine quoting. This failed if the absolute
	  path contained spaces, but the application name itself not. This
	  bug caused no trouble on Win NT 5, but does for other variants
	  in the Win* family. Report and fix due to Ken Poole
	  <kenpoole@users.sourceforge.net>.

2001-08-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added QNX-6 build support. [Bug #219410] (loverso)

2001-08-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/http/http.tcl (geturl): added port number to Host:
	  header to comply with HTTP/1.1 spec (RFC 2068).  [Bug #452217]

2001-08-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/dde1.1/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/reg1.0/pkgIndex.tcl:  Package dependencies. [Patch 448931]

	* library/http/http.tcl:  
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:  Upgrade to http 2.3.2.

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:  
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:  Upgrade to msgcat 1.1.1.

	* library/opt/optparse.tcl:  
	* library/opt/pkgIndex.tcl:  Upgrade to opt 0.4.3.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:  
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:  Upgrade to tcltest 1.0.1.

2001-08-07  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Avoid panic when there are extra items in
	  the tcl stack [Bugs #406709 and 439843, Patch #414470]
	* tests/foreach.test: test to exercise the patch

2001-08-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd, Tcl_RegsubObjCmd):
	reordered the retrieval of arguments to avoid shimmering bug when
	the pattern and string referenced the same object.

	* unix/configure: regenerated
	* unix/tcl.m4: added GNU (HURD) configuration target. (brinkmann)
	[Patch: #442974]

2001-08-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure: regenerated
	* win/tcl.m4: fixed DLLSUFFIX definition to always be ${DBGX}.dll.
	This is necessary for TEA compliant builds that build shared
	against a static-built Tcl.
	* win/Makefile.in ($(TCLSH)): added $(TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE) to build
	target, otherwise it wouldn't get generated in a static build.

2001-08-06  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_GetsObjCmd): Applied patch from SF item
	  [442665] to fix the bug reported by it. The function can corrupt
	  a freed object if it is called with objc == 3. This is because
	  it retrieves resultPtr and does not increment its reference
	  count, but then calls Tcl_ObjSetVar2, which causes the retrieved
	  resultPtr object to be released.

2001-07-18  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/bgerror.n: Fixed Tk! Bug #415757.

2001-07-18  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Aftermath to [SF #427196]. Squash empty buffers
	  if they are smaller than the requested buffersize, to prevent
	  reusage of old buffers and to honor changes in the requested
	  buffersize made by the user.

2001-07-17  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (GetInput): Fixed [SF #427196]. Memory was
	  overwritten because a buffer was used after a change of the
	  requested buffersize together with that requested buffersize and
	  not its actual size, which was smaller. Note that the continous
	  reuse of the smaller buffer negatively impacts performance. The
	  system never allocates a buffer with the newly requested bigger
	  buffersize.

2001-07-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (PipeClose2Proc): constrained the mutex lock to
	just the TerminateThread call and waiting for termination. (jsmith)

2001-07-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/util.test: added util-4.6
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_ConcatObj): Corrected walking backwards
	over utf-8 chars. [Bug #227512]

2001-06-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfBackslash): Corrected backslash
	handling of multibyte utf-8 chars. [Bug #217987]

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoProcsCmd): fixed potential mem leak in
	info procs that created objects without using them.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): fixed mem leak when
	string command failed to parse the subcommand.

2001-05-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclAllocateFreeObjects): simplified
	objSizePlusPadding to use sizeof(Tcl_Obj) (max)

2001-05-04  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

        ** Mac 8.3.3 binary release 

	**  detailed change log for changes to mac code for 8.3.3 
	**  (expands on log entries below marked 2001-04-04  Jeff Hobbs)

	* generic/tcl.h: MAC_TCL: addition of ConditionalMacros.h and use of
	DLLIMPORT and DLLEXPORT like on other platforms.  ( => no longer need
	the .exp files and can remove use of #pragma export that never worked
	well)

	* mac/tclMacShLib.exp:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.exp:
	* mac/tclMacMSLPrefix.h: removed files

	* mac/MW_TclBuildLibHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TclBuildLibHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclHeaderCommon.h:
	* mac/MW_TclStaticHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TclStaticHeader.pch: new precompiled header files

	* mac/MW_TclAppleScriptHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclTestHeader.pch:
	* mac/tclMacCommonPch.h: revised precompiled header handling: now
	include a common header file 'MW_TclHeaderCommon.h' from all .pch
	files, the .pch files themselves now only setup #defines (e.g.
	BUILD_tcl, STATIC_BUILD, TCL_DEBUG, TCL_THREADS) like in makefiles on
	other platforms.

	* mac/tclMac.h:
	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* mac/tclMacInt.h: use of BUILD_tcl and TCL_STORAGE_CLASS like on other
	platforms, standardize #include'd files to what's done on other
	platforms, removed use of #pragma export.

	* mac/tcltkMacBuildSupport.sea.hqx: new archive of mac build support
	files & suggested build environment directory hierarchy: 
	- 'Building MacTclTk' & 'CW Pro6 changes' readme's.
	- projects for MoreFiles 1.5.1 static & shared libraries.
	- project & sources for 'pseudoCarbonSupport', see below.

	* mac/tclMacProjects.sea.hqx: updated mac build project files:
	- build support for CodeWarrior Pro6, UnivIntf 3.4 & shared runtime
	libraries: the MSL libraries and MoreFiles are no longer compiled into
	Tcl.shlb, all non-static binaries now use the Pro6 shared runtime
	libraries and MoreFiles.shlb.  These shlbs are merged into the standard
	Wish and TclShell, but 3rd party applications linking with Tcl.shlb or
	Tk.shlb need to setup access to them.  (see the "(sh-ppc)" targets
	for how to do this.)
	- Merging the full MSL.shlb and the other shlbs into Wish & TclShell
	makes them a bit larger than before, use unmerged binaries to avoid
	copying the shared code with every application, e.g. when deploying
	numerous Wish based droplets.
	- Note that using CW Pro5 to compile extensions is in principle still
	possible, but need to link with Pro6 runtime libraries.
	- Tclapplescript now loads and runs on CFM68k.
	- Highly experimental "pseudoCarbon" support for Tcl only on OS 8/9:
	binaries in "Build:(Carbon):" link against CarbonLib instead of
	InterfaceLib, however the actual code has not been carbonized! i.e. it
	will not run on OSX and may not even run properly with CarbonLib. 
	This should in principle allow you to build & test OS9 CFM Carbon
	binaries that need to link with Tcl.shlb.  On OSX you can use the
	native Tcl.framework, but you have to build a MachO binary as there
	is no CFM glue lib for Tcl.framework.
	the library pseudoCarbonSupport.shlb manually loads the symbols
	from InterfaceLib that are not in CarbonLib but are needed by the
	uncarbonized code in Tcl.shlb and TclShell.

	* generic/tclMain.c: MAC_TCL: workaround for broken/non-standard isatty
	on MW Pro6, #include <unistd.h> instead of defining isatty

	* mac/tclMacPort.h: MW Pro6 changes for MSL fcntl.h, stat.h & isatty

	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c: add EXTERN to InstallConsole to enable DLL
	export via the TCL_STORAGE_CLASS mechanism.

	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c: fix for FSpDirectoryCopy API change

	* mac/tclMacLibrary.c: emit compile time error when
	TCL_REGISTER_LIBRARY and USE_TCL_STUBS are both defined at the same
	time in an extension, this use is not currently supported and will
	result in a crash when dynamically loading the extension.

	* mac/tclMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tclMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.r:
	* mac/tclMacResource.r: fixed obsolete copyrights/dates in version
	strings; updated version strings to standard usage; added support for
	'(Support Libraries)' subfolder for shared runtime libraries in
	unmerged binaries; commented out demo setting of "Tcl Environment
	Variables"

	* mac/tclMacChan.c:
	* mac/tclMacSock.c: cast for *BlockMode

	* mac/tclMacUtil.c:
	* mac/tclMacMath.h: removed obsolete hypot() definition

	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* mac/tclMacNotify.c:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.c:
	* mac/tclMacUtil.c:
	* generic/tclThreadTest.c: renamed routines conflicting with standard
	Apple or MoreFiles headers (at compile or link time):
	    GetGlobalMouse         -> GetGlobalMouseTcl
    	FSpGetDirectoryID      -> FSpGetDirectoryIDTcl
    	FSpOpenResFileCompat   -> FSpOpenResFileCompatTcl
    	FSpCreateResFileCompat -> FSpCreateResFileCompatTcl
		NewThread              -> NewTestThread
	the renamed MoreFiles *Tcl routines are just wrappers calling into the
	MoreFiles DLL.

	* mac/tclMacCommonPch.h:
	* mac/tclMacThrd.c:
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c: removed OLDROUTINENAMES define, renamed obsolete
	apple API names to modern equivalents; UH3.4 support: added #include
	<ControlDefinitions.h>, updated New*Proc() calls to New*UPP().

	* mac/tclMacUnix.c: added missing (Tcl_Obj ***) cast to
	Tcl_ListObjGetElements call

	* mac/tclMacAlloc.c: modernized TclpSysAlloc() to use temporary
	memory instead of system heap memory when available (MacOS
	>= 7.5 and possibly earlier, use of system heap has been
	discouraged for a long time and has many disadvantages, e.g. memory
	isn't paged out, and errors can very easily bring the system down);
	fixed crashing bug in TclpSysRealloc() and CleanUpExitProc() where
	memory was being accessed after having been deallocated; fixed
	memory leak in (de)allocation code (for every block ever allocated
	with TclpSysAlloc, a Ptr was leaked), if temporary memory is
	available, don't track allocated memory, instead use
	RecoverHandle() to get Handle from Ptr, otherwise use doubly linked
	list to correctly track memory and free all allocated memory; added
	new option for ConfigureMemory: MEMORY_DONT_USE_TEMPMEM, disables
	use of temporary memory even when it would be available, only
	necessary when writing e.g. a driver (using tcl??); increased
	fraction of application heap reserved for OS routines to 512K

2001-04-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/install-sh: added -S option
	* unix/tcl.m4: added Rhapsody/Darwin target
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c (TclpLoadFile): 
	* unix/tclMtherr.c (matherr): added support for Mac OS X

2001-04-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclAllocateFreeObjects): simplified
	objSizePlusPadding to use sizeof(Tcl_Obj) (max)

	* win/README:
	* win/README.binary: removed note about use of registry (hasn't
	been used for loading since 8.0).

2001-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

2001-04-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4 (SHLIB_LD):  added -incremental:no. [Bug #219381]

2001-03-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c (TclFinalizeMemorySubsystem): set curTagPtr
	to NULL to allow for reuse.
	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): moved the tsdPtr
	initialization inside the subsystemsInitialized check to prevent
	it potentially getting called twice during finalization.  (wu)
	[Patch #403532, Bug #219391]

	* win/tclWinSock.c (SocketEventProc): Fixed race condition in
	readability of socket on Windows.
	[Patch #410674, Bug #219205 #219333]

	* win/tcl.m4: added imm32.lib to LIBS_GUI for Tk IME support.

	* win/Makefile.in (install-doc): improved install-* targets to use
	their base build dependency.

2001-03-29  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* tests/interp.test: Print out warning when
	testinterpdelete command is not defined.
	Add tests that checks to make sure a
	child interp inherits the parent's cwd.

2001-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpCreateTempFile): prevent potential race
	condition and security leak in tmp filename creation.
 	(max) [Patch #402924]

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: corrected IRIX-5.x config to not use -n32.
 	(english) [Patch #403626]

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (Tcl_ConditionWait): fixed handling of
	timeout for threads (corrects excessive CPU usage issue for Tk on
	Unix in threaded Tcl environment). (ruppert) [Bug #411603]

2001-03-26  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinInt.h (tclWinTCharEncoding): Removed as now a static
	variable in win/tclWin32Dll.c instead.

2001-03-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_ArrayObjCmd): Corrected retrieval of
	resultPtr to prevent possible corruption.

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_Import): Correctly freed a DString.
 	(lavana) [Patch #403755]

2001-03-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* library/package.tcl (pkg_mkIndex):  Added patch from Vince
	Darley to make [pkg_mkIndex -verbose] even more verbose.
	[Bug 219349, Patch 403529]

2001-03-13  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): A missing
	{return TCL_OK;} was causing memory corruption.  [Bug #408002]

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclDeleteExecEnv, GrowEvaluationStack,
	TclExecuteByteCode): Added some casts to ClientData that are
	apparently needed on some architectures.

2001-03-02  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Fixed bug that could
	pass pointers to freed memory to command implementations, which
	most obviously caused some weird behaviour with [info level], but
	could have caused problems with user code and command traces too.
	[Bug 404865, Patch 405436]

2001-02-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SplitObjCmd): Improved efficiency of
	splitting strings into individual characters by adding hash so
	that only one Tcl_Obj per character is created.  Improves
	performance of splitting of short strings and makes a huge
	difference to splitting of long strings, such as is done in the
	mime package in tcllib.  [Bug #131523]

2001-01-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): Moved code that updates the count
	of how many bytes are left to copy.  Corrects bug that when
	writing occurs in the background, the copy loop could be
	escaped without updating the count, causing CopyData() to try
	to copy more bytes than the toRead value originally passed to
	TclCopyChannel(), leading to hangs and misreporting of number
	of bytes copied. [Bug 118203, Patch 103432]

2001-01-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>
	* tests/unixInit.test:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  Several entries in
	the library path ($tcl_libPath) are determined relative to the
	absolute path of the executable.  When the executable is
	installed in or near the root directory of the file system,
	relative pathnames were being incorrectly generated, and in
	the worst case, memory access violations were crashing the program.
	[Bug 119416, Patch 102972]

2000-12-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* tests/expr-old.test:  Re-wrote Tcl's [expr rand()] and
	[expr srand($seed)] implementations, fixing a range error
	on some 64-bit platforms.  Added tests that detect the bug.
	The rewrite changes the seed -> sequence map on 64-bit
	platforms, only for seed >= 2^31, a slight incompatibility.
	[Bug 121072, Patch 102781]

2000-12-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl:
	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/opt/optparse.tcl:
	* library/opt/pkgIndex.tcl: Where [uplevel] is used in a proc
	to evaluate a Tcl built-in command in the caller's context,
	the built-in commands are now fully namespace-qualified.  This
	prevents problems when the caller context is in a namespace where
	the built-in command name has been used by a command in the
	namespace.  (For example, [::ns::set] might be called instead
	of the intended [::set]).  [Bug #119422, Patch #102545]

2000-12-09  jeff hobbs  <jhobbs@interwoven.com>

	* docs/scan.n:
	* tests/scan.test:
	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): changed %o and %x to use
	strtoul instead of strtol to correctly preserve scan<>format
	conversion of large integers.  [Patch #102663, Bug #124600]

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Commited patch fixing
	handling of {!<boolean>} in expressions. [Patch #102702]

2000-12-08  jeff hobbs  <jhobbs@interwoven.com>

	* library/init.tcl: Added support for PATHEXT variable in
	auto_execok, recognizing the proper set of executable extensions
	on Windows.  [Patch #102719]

2000-12-08  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (LoadTableEncoding): Changed dangerous
	  code to something less critical. This fixes bug 119417, part A
	  without affecting the speed when loading encodings.

2000-11-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Logical negation "!"
	  can now handle string booleans, provided those values are placed
	  in variables.

	* tests/expr.test (expr-13.17): Check that [expr {!$var}] can
	  negate the string-versions of booleans "yes", "false", etc.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl (getMatchingFiles,
	  getMatchingDirectories):
	* tools/man2html.tcl (doDir): 
	* tools/man2help.tcl (doDir): 
	* library/package.tcl (tclPkgUnknown,tclMacPkgSearch): 
	* library/safe.tcl (AddSubDirs): [glob] uses -directory instead of
	  unsafe [file join] to fix Bug #123313

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c:
	* generic/tclTestObj.c (TestindexobjCmd): Changed internal
	  representation of index objects to fix Bug #119082; fix
	  shouldn't be visible to outside world...

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestGetIndexFromObjStructObjCmd): 
	* tests/indexObj.test: (indexObj-6.*) Added to test for presence
	  of Bug #119082.

2000-11-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsortObjCmd): Fixed memory leak from Bug
	  #119398

	* library/init.tcl (unknown): Added specific level parameters to
	  all uplevel invokations to boost performance; didn't dare touch
	  the "namespace inscope" stuff though, since it looks sensitive
	  to me!  Should fix Bug #123217, though testing is tricky...

2000-11-16  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h (line 69): Changed reference to winsock2.h into
 	  winsock.h. This was a leftover from a foray into using winsock
 	  version 2 (History lesson from Scott Redman and Jeff
 	  Hobbs). This code was no problem when compiling Tcl itself, but
 	  could trip extensions. Fixes bug 122568.

2000-11-02  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c: tclLibraryPath Tcl_Obj didn't have a way
	to share its data among threads.  This caused Tcl_Init() to
	always fail in threads.  Added a way to pass the data around
	with a global char*.  [BUG: 5301]

2000-11-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/dltest/configure:
	* win/configure:
	* tools/configure: checked in configure scripts so people doing
	CVS checkouts aren't required to have autoconf.  Changes to
	configure.in in the future will require the corresponding
	configure script to also be re-autoconf'ed and checked in.

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/tcl.m4: makefile fixes for Win64 support

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct): minor cast
	changes.

2000-11-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: removed use of -lbsd and -ldl for AIX-5.

	* tests/subst.test: added tests for non-zero return code handling
	by subst.
	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_EvalEx): corrected handling of non-zero,
	non-error return code cases for subst. [BUG: 119829]

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclVarTraceExists): Corrected excessive mem
	use when info exists was called on a non-existent array element.
	[BUG: 119213, 119336]

2000-10-30  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/configure.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/tcl.rc:
	* win/tclsh.rc: Added logic to derive filenames better in the resource
	scripts based on compile options.

2000-10-30  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: added default encoding map from
	"ja_JP.eucJP" to "euc-jp". (takahashi)

	* tests/clock.test: corrected clock-2.* test numbering

	* unix/configure.in (SC_TCL_LINK_LIBS): removed code that was
	commented out (it had been moved to tcl.m4's SC_TCL_LINK_LIBS
	already).

	* unix/tcl.m4: consolidated gettimeofday check for AIX.

2000-10-27  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added support for AIX-5.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_NotifyChannel): removed #ifdef around code
	for old channel structures, placed preserve/release around statePtr
	* generic/tclIO.c (CloseChannel): the statePtr for a channel was
	not being freed when the last channel in a stack was freed,
	causing a mem leak.

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: updated channel types to strict
	TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2 style to avoid compiler warnings.  They work
	either way, but this avoids compiler warnings (that worries people).

2000-10-26  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchFilesTypes): NULL was being set to
	"attr" which was a DWORD.  Changed NULL to zero because a 'void *'
	can't be set to a DWORD to avoid the compiler warning.

2000-10-20  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchFilesTypes): made the stat call only
	occur when necessary (for 'glob' command).  Significantly speeds
	up glob command from 8.3. [BUG: 6216]

2000-10-06  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: moved Win2K bug case test with GetStdHandle()
	from TclpGetDefaultStdChannel into Tcl_MakeFileChannel to enable
	a more general method in detecting invalid OS handles rather than
	just a specific known case. [BUG: 5971]

2000-10-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: extra tests for 'file channels' that include
	multiple interpreter tests and channel sharing
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_GetChannelNamesEx): corrected function (and
	consequently 'file channels') to return channels that are actually
	registered for this specific interp, rather than this thread.

2000-09-29  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialGetOptionProc): corrected reporting of
	space parity on Windows (Eason) [Bug 6057].

	* win/Makefile.in: commented use of TESTFLAGS
	* unix/Makefile.in: added TESTFLAGS to test target to
	conform with Windows makefile and TEA style.

	* tests/stack.test: prevented possible crash on systems with low
	default stacksize (Tru64, AIX) in infinite recursion test.  A
	solution to check remaining stack space in the core is best, but
	hard to do in a cross-platform manner.

	* generic/tclIOGT.c (FLUSH_DELAY): renamed DELAY define to
	FLUSH_DELAY to avoid defn conflict using Tru64's cc.

2000-09-28  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* tools/tcl.wse.in: added tclPlatDecls.h and tkPlatDecls.h to the
	Windows .exe install.

	* tests/fCmd.test (fCmd-6.20): corrected test to remove
	c:/tcl8975@ after creating it.

	* tests/fileName.test: cleaned up the testing of glob patterns for
	c:/globTest (Windows) to directly create/remove directory.
2000-09-27  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@ajubasolutions.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (StopCopy): fixed a bug introduced by a partial
	fix in 8.3.2 that didn't set nonBlocking correctly when resetting
	the flags for the write side.  [Bug: 6261]

	***************************************************************

	which was causing [history redo] to start its search at the wrong
	event index. [Bug: 1269].

	* generic/tclPosixStr.c (Tcl_SignalMsg): clarified #defines for
	Linux on Sparc to compile correctly. [Bug: 5364]

	* generic/tclEnv.c: cast cleanup [Bug: 5624]
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: cast cleanup [Bug: 5627]

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct): Corrected
	caching of the index ptr to account for offsets != sizeof(char *).
	[Bug: 5153]

	* tests/opt.test:
	* library/opt0.4/optparse.tcl: Applied patch from [Bug: 5922], which 
	corrected an incorrect use of [string match].

	* tests/stringObj.test: Tweaked tests to avoid hardcoded
	high-ASCII characters (which will fail in multibyte locales);
	instead used \uXXXX syntax. [Bug: 3842].

2000-08-05  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclIOGT.c (TclChannelTransform): fixed segfault that
	would occur when transforming a channel with a proc that did not
	yet exist. (Kupries)

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestChannelCmd): added some lint init'ing of
	statePtr and chan vars.

2000-07-28  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/configure.in:
	* win/tcl.m4:
	* win/tclConfig.sh.in: Back port of gcc for windows
	build system from 8.4.

2000-07-26  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* merged core-8-3-1-io-rewrite back into core-8-3-1-branch.
	The core-8-3-1-io-rewrite branch should now be considered defunct.

	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclIO.c: moved the Tcl_Channel* macros from tcl.h to
	tclIO.c and made them proper stubbed functions.  These are:
	Tcl_ChannelName, Tcl_ChannelVersion, Tcl_ChannelBlockModeProc,
	Tcl_ChannelCloseProc, Tcl_ChannelClose2Proc, Tcl_ChannelInputProc,
	Tcl_ChannelOutputProc, Tcl_ChannelSeekProc, Tcl_ChannelSetOptionProc,
	Tcl_ChannelGetOptionProc, Tcl_ChannelWatchProc,
	Tcl_ChannelGetHandleProc, Tcl_ChannelFlushProc,
	and Tcl_ChannelHandlerProc.  These should be used to access the
	Tcl_ChannelType structure instead of direct pointer dereferencing.

	* unix/Makefile.in: undid 07-25 Makefile.in changes because we
	don't really want to force all private makefiles on everyone.
	This needs to be addressed again in the future.  Best possible
	solution is to create a tcl/ subdir in the installing include dir
	(as is done already with the lib dir).

	* tests/iogt.test: added RCS string, marked tests 2.* to be
	unixOnly due to underlying system differences.

	* tests/all.tcl: corrected additional sets by Kupries for testing.

2000-07-25 Brent Welch	<welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Need to install all the Tcl headers because
	Itcl depends on internal headers.

2000-07-25 Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* tests/iogt.test: (line 866f) New tests iogt-6.[01], highlighting
 	  buffering trouble when stacking and unstacking transformations.
	  iogt-6.0 is solved, see the changes below. iogt-6.1 remains, for
 	  now, due to the perceived complexity of solutions.

	* generic/tclIO.h: (line 139f) struct Channel, added a buffer
	  queue, to hold data pushed back when stacking a transformation.

	* generic/tclIO.c:
	  (line 91f, line 7434f) New internal function 'CopyBuffer'.
	  Derived from 'CopyAndTranslateBuffer', with translation
	  removed.
	  (line 1025f, line 1212f): Initialization of new queue.
	  (line 1164f, Tcl_StackChannel): Pushback of input queue.
	  (line 1293f, Tcl_UnstackChannel): Discard input and pushback.
	  (line 3748f, Tcl_ReadRaw): Modified to use data in the push back
	  area before going to the driver. Uses 'CopyBuffer', s.a.
	  (line 4702f, GetInput): Modified to use data in the push back
	  area before going to the driver.
 	  (line 4867f, Tcl_Seek): Modified to take pushback of the topmost
	  channel in a stack into account.
	  (line 5620f, Tcl_InputBuffered): See above. Added
	  'Tcl_ChannelBuffered'. Analogue to 'Tcl_InputBuffered' but for
	  the buffer area in the channel.

	* generic/tcl.decls: New public API 'Tcl_ChannelBuffered'. S.a.

2000-07-19  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/socket.test: removed doTestsWithRemoteServer constraint
	from socket-12.*.  It requires 'exec', not a remote server.
	Cleaned up some coding errors.

2000-07-18 Brent Welch	<welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Added rules for static tcldde and tclreg libraries.

2000-07-17  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* README:
	* win/README:
	* win/README.binary:
	* win/configure.in:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_RELEASE_SERIAL): updated to patchlevel 8.3.2

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: added tclIOGT.c to objects list to compile.

	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls: commented out internal decls for
	TclTestChannelCmd and TclTestChannelEventCmd as they were moved to
	tclTest.c.  Added new decls for TclChannelEventScriptInvoker and
	TclChannelTransform.

	* generic/tclIO.h: new file that contains the main internal
	structures of Tcl_Channel code to allow for multiple files to
	access them.
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* generic/tclIO.c: broke into 3 files - tclIO.c core code, tclIO.h
	header code, and tclIOGT.c - the giot test code from Kupries.  The
	channel test code also moved to tclTest.c.
	* generic/tclIO.c (CloseChannel): stopped masking out of the
	TCL_READABLE|TCL_WRITABLE bits from the state flags in
	CloseChannel, instead adding extra intelligence to
	CheckChannelErrors with a new CHANNEL_RAW_MODE bit for special
	behavior when called from Raw channel APIs.

2000-07-13  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (StackSetBlockMode): moved set of chanPtr
	outside of blockModeProc check to avoid infinite loop when
	blockModeProc was NULL (Kupries).  updated TransformSeekProc to
	not call Tcl_Seek directly (Kupries).

	* win/tclWinChan.c: updated fileChannelType to v2 channel struct
	* win/tclWinConsole.c: updated consoleChannelType to v2 channel struct
	* win/tclWinPipe.c: updated pipeChannelType to v2 channel struct
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: updated serialChannelType to v2 channel struct
	* win/tclWinSock.c: updated tcpChannelType to v2 channel struct

2000-07-11  Brent Welch	<welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* win/tclConfig.sh.in: Cleaned up unix-specific autoconf variables.

2000-07-11  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/iogt.test: made tests [345].0 not run by default as they
	were failing in the new design, but I'm not convinced that the
	returned result isn't correct.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tcl.decls: added Tcl_GetTopChannel C API that returns
	the current top channel of a channel stack.  Tcl_GetChannel was
	changed earlier to return the bottommost channel of a stack
	because that is the one that is guaranteed to stay around the
	longest, and this was needed to compensate for certain
	operations that want to look at the state of the main channel.
	Most channel APIs already compensate for grabbing the top, so it
	shouldn't be needed often.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_StackChannel, Tcl_UnstackChannel): Added
	flushing of buffers (Kupries), removed use of DownChannel macro,
	added Tcl_GetTopChannel public API to get to the top channel of
	the channel stack (necessary for TLS).  Rewrote Tcl_NotifyChannel
	for new channel design (Kupries).  Did some code cleanup in the
	transform code.  tclIO.c must still be broken into bits (separate
	out test code and giot code, create tclIO.h).

2000-07-10  Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* tests/iogt.test: Reverted some earlier changes as a fix by Jeff
	  revived the original and correct behaviour. IOW, the tests showed
	  a genuine error and I didn't see it :(.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Read|Write_Raw): Changed to directly use
 	  the drivers and not DoRead|DoWrite. The latter use the buffering
 	  system, encoding and eol-translation and this wreaks havoc with
 	  the data going through the transformations. Both procedures use
 	  CheckForchannelErrors and let it believe that there is no
 	  background copy in progress or else stacked channels could not
	  be used for that.

	* generic/tclIO.c (TclCopyChannel, CopyData): Moved access to the
 	  topmost channel from the first to the second procedure to make
 	  the decision about that at the last possible time (Callbacks can
 	  change the stacking).

	test suite: failures of iogt-[345].0
	
2000-07-06  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/iogt.test: new tests for stacked channel stuff based off
	new 'testchannel transform|unstack' code (Kupries IOGT extension).
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubsInit.c:
	* generic/tclIO.c: complete rewrite of Tcl Channel code for
	stacked channels.  Channels are now designed to work in a more
	stacked fashion with a shared ChannelState data structure.

2000-06-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CloseChannel): removed the &ing out of
	(TCL_READABLE|TCL_WRITABLE) from the flags, as CloseChannel does
	this on the next pass through for the top channel, and it appeared
	to be causing hangs by not allowing the final flush.

2000-06-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CloseChannel): Rewrote CloseChannel code to
	unstack a channel during the close process.  Fixed a refcount bug
	in Tcl_UnstackChannel.  [Bug: 5623]
	(CloseChannel): further extended CloseChannel in the stacked case
	to effect certain operations on the next channel that would have
	been done in Tcl_Close.  Also added CHANNEL_CLOSED and removed
	(TCL_READABLE|TCL_WRITABLE) bits from chanPtr->flags.  Changed
	final reset of the WatchProc to check the chanDownPtr's (next)
	interestMask.

2000-05-29  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* tests/http.test
	* doc/http.n
	* library/http2.3/http.tcl: Fixed bug 5741, where unsuccessful
	geturl calls sometimes leaked memory and resources (sockets).  
	Also, switched around some of the logic so that http::wait never 
	throws an exception.  This is because in an asynchronous geturl, 
	the command callback will probably end up doing all the error 
	handling anyway, and in an asynchronous situation, the user
	expects to check the state when the transaction completes, as
	opposed to being thrown an exception.	For the http package, this
	menas the user can check http::status for "error" and http::error
	for the error message after doing the http::wait.

2000-04-24  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_FinalizeNotifier, NotifierThreadProc):
	added write of 'q' into triggerPipe for notifier in threaded case,
	so that Tcl doesn't hang when children are still running [Bug: 4139]

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (Tcl_MutexLock): minor comment fixes.

2000-04-23  Jim Ingham  <jingham@cygnus.com>

	These changes make some error handling marginally better for Mac
	sockets.  It is still somewhat flakey, however.

	* mac/tclMacSock.c (TcpClose): Add timeouts to the close - these
	don't seem to be honored, however.
	Use a separate PB for the release, since an async connect socket
	will still be using the original buffer.
	Make sure TCPRelease returns noErr before freeing the recvBuff.
	If the call returns an error, then the buffer is not right.
	* mac/tclMacSock.c (CreateSocket): Add timeouts to the async
	create. These don't seem to trigger, however.  Sigh...
	* mac/tclMacSock.c (WaitForSocketEvent): If an TCP_ASYNC_CONNECT
	socket errors out, then return EWOULDBLOCK & error out.
	* mac/tclMacSock.c (NotifyRoutine): Added a NotifyRoutine for
	experimenting with MacTCP.

2000-04-22  Jim Ingham <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* library/package.tcl (tclPkgUnknown): Fixed a typo in the Mac package
	search part of tclPkgUnknown.

2000-04-21  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Fixed a newly introduced bug where if
	there's a -command callback and something goes wrong, geturl threw
	an exception, called the callback, and unset the token.  I changed
	it so that it will not call the callback when throwing an
	exception (so the caller only finds out about a given error from
	one place).  Also, fixed http::ncode so that it actually gives you
	back the http return code (i.e. 200, 404, etc.) instead of the
	first digit of the version of HTTP being used (i.e. 1).

2000-04-21  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: More thrashing with the "server closes
	without reading post data" scenario.  Reverted to the previous
	filevent configuratiuon, which seems to work better with small
	amounts of post data.  

2000-04-20  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclAlloc.c: wrapped caddr_t define to not be done on Unix
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: added Tclp*Alloc defines to allow the use of
	USE_TCLALLOC on Unix. [Bug: 4731]

	* library/dde1.1/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/reg1.0/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* win/tclWinChan.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: converted CRLF to LF the */tcl.hpj.in files

	* win/Makefile.in: expanded cleanup target for help files

	* doc/Thread.3: minor macro cleanup

2000-04-11  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: Added "CONST" keyword to declaration of char
	*native in TclpCreateTempFile, to supress compiler warnings.

2000-04-10  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

2000-04-10  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclpCreateTempFile): Added conversion of
	contents string from UTF to native encoding [Bug: 4030].

	* tests/regexp.test: Added tests for infinite looping in [regexp
	-all].
	
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Fixed infinite loop bug with [regexp -all]
	[Bug: 4981].

	* tests/*.test: Changed all occurances of "namespace import
	::tcltest" to "namespace import -force ::tcltest" [Bug: 3948].

2000-04-09  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* lib/httpd2.1/http.tcl: Worked on the "server closes before
	reading post data" case, which unfortunately causes different
	error cases on Solaris, which can read the reply, and Linux
	and Windows, which cannot read anything.  This is all in the
	loop-back case - client and server on the same host.  Also
	unified the error handling so the "ioerror" status goes away
	and errors are reflected in a more uniform way. Updated the
	man page to document the behavior.

2000-04-09  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/reg.test (matchexpected): corrected tests to use tcltest
	constraint types to skip certain tests.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_SetCommandInfo): comment fix

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (Tcl_CreateThread): moved TCL_THREADS ifdef
	inside of func as it is declared for non-threads builds as well.
	In the non-threads case, it always returns TCL_ERROR (couldn't
	create thread).

2000-04-08  Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Overall change: Definition of a public API for the creation of
	  new threads.

	* generic/tclInt.h (line 1802f): Removed the definition of
	'TclpThreadCreate'. (line 793f) Removed the definition of
	'Tcl_ThreadCreateProc'.

	* generic/tcl.h (line 388f): Readded the definition of
	  'Tcl_ThreadCreateProc'. Added Win32 stuff send in by David
	  Graveraux <davygrvy@bigfoot.com> to that too (__stdcall,
	  ...). Added macros for the default stacksize and allowed flags.

	* generic/tcl.decls (line 1356f): Added definition of
	  'Tcl_CreateThread', slot 393 of the stub table. Two new
	  arguments in the public API, for stacksize and flags.

	* win/tclWinThrd.c:
	* mac/tclMacThrd.c: Renamed TclpThreadCreate to Tcl_CreateThread,
	  added handling of the stacksize. Flags are currently ignored.

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: See above, but handles joinable
	  flag. Ignores the specified stacksize if the macro
	  HAVE_PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKSIZE is not defined.

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (line 363): See below.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (line 210): Adapted to the changes
	  above. Uses default stacksize and no flags now.

	* unic/tcl.m4 (line 382f): Added a check for
	  'pthread_attr_setstacksize' to detect platforms not implementing
	  this feature of pthreads. If it is implemented, configure will
	  define the macro HAVE_PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKSIZE (See
	  unix/tclUnixThrd.c too).

	* doc/Thread.3: Added Tcl_CreateThread and its arguments to the
	  list of described functions. Removed stuff about not providing a
	  public C-API for thread-creation.

2000-04-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/binary.n: clarified docs on sign extension in binary scan
	[Bug: 3466]

	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl (initConstraints): removed win32s
	references (no longer supported)

	* tests/fCmd.test: marked test 8.1 knownBug because it is
	dangerous on poorly configured systems [Bug: 3881]
	and added 8.2 to keep essence of 8.1 tested.

2000-04-05  Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_UnstackChannel, line 1831): Forcing
	interest mask to the correct value after an unstack and
	re-initialization of the notifier via the watchProc. Without this
	the first fileevent after an unstack will come through and be
	processed, but no more. [Bug: ??].

	* {win,unix}/Makefile.in: added dependency of tclStubInit.c on
	tcl.decls and tclInt.decls
	* generic/tclThread.c: Tweak so this compiles w/out TCL_THREADS
	* generic/{tcl.decls,tclStubInit.c}:  Just touched the tcl.decls and
	regenerated the tclStubInit.c file

2000-03-29  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: For the -querychannel option,
	fconfigure the socket to be binary so that we don't translate
	anything while reading the data.  This is because we determine the
	content length of the data on the channel by using seek (to the end
	of the file) and tell on the file handle, and we need the
	content-length to match the amount of data actually sent, and
	translation can affect the number of bytes posted.

2000-04-03  Andreas Kupries <a.kupries@westend.com>

	* Overall change: Definition of public API's for the finalization
	of conditions and mutexes. [Bug: 4199].

	* generic/tclInt.h: Removed definitions of TclFinalizeMutex and
	TclFinalizeCondition.

	* generic/tcl.decls: Added declarations of Tcl_MutexFinalize and
	Tcl_ConditionFinalize.

	* generic/tclThread.c: Renamed TclFinalizeMutex to
	Tcl_MutexFinalize. Renamed TclFinalizeCondition to
	Tcl_ConditionFinalize.

	* generic/tclNotify.c: Changed usage of TclFinalizeMutex to
	Tcl_MutexFinalize.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: 
	* generic/tclThreadTest.c: Changed usages of TclFinalizeCondition to
	Tcl_ConditionFinalize.

	* generic/tcl.h: Added empty macros for Tcl_MutexFinalize and
	Tcl_ConditionFinalize, to be used when the core is compiled
	without threads. 

	* doc/Thread.3:	Added description the new API's.

2000-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoVarsCmd): checked for non-NULL procPtr
	to prevent itcl info override crash [Bug: 4064]

	* tests/foreach.test:
	* tests/namespace.test:
	* tests/var.test: Added lsorts to avoid random sorted return
	problems. [Bug: 2682]

	* tests/fileName.test: fixed 14.1 test fragility [Bug: 1482]

	* tools/man2help2.tcl: fixed winhelp cross-linking error [Bug: 4156]
	improved translation to winhelp [Bug: 3679]

	* unix/Makefile.in (MAN_INSTALL_DIR): patch to accept --mandir
	correctly [Bug: 4085]

	* unix/dltest/pkg[a-e].c: Cleaned up test packages [Bug: 2293]

2000-04-03  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (SetGroupAttribute): 
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (SetOwnerAttribute): Added (uid_t) and (gid_t) 
	casts to avoid compiler warnings.

2000-03-31  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclGet.c (Tcl_GetDouble): Added additional conditions to
	error test (previously only errno was checked, but the return
	value of strtod() should be checked as well).  [Bug: 4118].

	* tests/exec.test: Added test for proper conversion of UTF data
	when used with "<< $dataWithUTF" on exec's.

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpCreateTempFile): Added
	Tcl_UtfToExternalDString call, so that if there is UTF content in
	the string it will be properly converted to the system encoding
	before being written [Bug: 4030].
	(TclpCreateTempFile): Added a check on the return value of tmpnam;
	some systems (Linux, for example) will start to return NULL after
	tmpnam has been called TMP_MAX times; not checking for this can
	have bad results (overwriting temp files, core dumps, etc.)

2000-03-30  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken): Added comments
	noting the need to pair ckalloc with ckfree. [Bug: 4262]

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: removed TclWinSynchSpawn (vestige of Win32s
	support).

	* win/tclWinReg.c: made use of TclWinGetPlatformId instead of
	getting info again

	* win/tclWinPort.h:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/configure.in:
	* win/tcl.m4: Added support for gcc/mingw on Windows [Bug: 4234]

2000-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCleanupByteCode): made ByteCode cleanup
	more aware of TCL_BYTECODE_PRECOMPILED flagged structs (gen'd by
	tbcload), to correctly clean them up.

	* generic/tclClock.c (FormatClock): moved check for empty format
	earlier, commented 0 result return value

2000-03-29  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Removed an unnecessary fileevent
	statement from the error processing part of the Write method.
	Also, fixed two potential memory leaks in wait and reset, in which
	the state array wasn't being unset before throwing an exception.
	Prior to this version, Brent checked in a fix to catch a
	fileevent statement that was sometimes causing a stack trace when
	geturl was called with -timeout.  I believe Brent's fix is
	necessary because TLS closes bad sockets for secure connections,
	and the fileevent was trying to act on a socket that no longer
	existed.

2000-03-27  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/httpd: removed unnecessary 'puts stderr "Post Dispatch"'

	* tests/namespace.test:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_Export): added a uniq'ing test to the
	export list so only one instance of each export pattern would
	exist in the list.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): optimized case for
	the empty string in ==/!= comparisons

2000-03-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: Added (off_t) type casts in lseek() call
	[Bug: 4409].

	* unix/tclLoadAout.c: 
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c: Added (off_t) type casts in lseek() calls
	[Bug: 4410].

2000-03-22  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Fixed a bug where string query data
	that was bigger than queryblocksize would get duplicate characters
	at block boundaries.

2000-03-22  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Fixed bug 4463, where we were getting
	a stack trace if we tried to publish a project to a good host but
	a port where there was no server listening.  It turned out the
	problem was a stray fileevent that needed to be cleared.  Also,
	fixed a bug where http::code could stack trace if called on a bad
	token (one which didn't represent a successful geturl) by adding
	an http element to the state array in geturl.

2000-03-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/clock.test: Modified some tests that were not robust with
	respect to the time zone in which they were run and were thus
	failing.

	* doc/clock.n: Clarified meaning of -gmt with respect to -base
	when used with [clock scan] (-gmt does not affect the
	interpretation of -base).

2000-03-19  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: geturl used to throw an exception when
	the connection failed; I accidentally returned a token with the
	error info, breaking backwards compatibility.  I changed it back
	to throwing an exception, but unsetting the state array first
	(thus still eliminating the original memory leak problem).

2000-03-19  Sandeep Tamhankar <sandeep@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Added -querychannel option and altered
	some of Brent's modifications to allow asynchronous posts (via
	-command).  Also modified -queryprogress so that it calls the
	query callback as <callback> <token> <total size> <current size>
	to be consistent with -progress.  Added -queryblocksize option
	with default 8192 bytes for post blocksize.  Fixed a bunch of
	potential memory leaks for the case when geturl receives bad args
	or can't open a socket, etc.  Overall, the package really rocks
	now.

	* doc/http.n: Added -queryblocksize, -querychannel, and
	-queryprogress.  Also, changed the description of -blocksize,
	which states that the -progress callback will be called for each
	block, to now qualify that with an "if -progress is specified".

	* tests/http.test: Added a querychannel test for synchronous and
	asynchronous posts, altered the queryprogress test such that the
	callback conforms to the -progress format.  Also, had to use the
	-queryblocksize option to do the post 16K at a time to match
	Brent's expected results (and to test that -queryblocksize works).

2000-03-15  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Added -queryprogress callback to
	http::geturl and also changed it so that writing the post data
	is event driven if the queryprogress callback or a timeout is given.
	This allows a timeout to occur when writing lots of post data.
	The queryprogress callback is called after each block of query
	data is posted.  It has the same signature as the -progress callback.

2000-03-06  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/package.tcl: Applied patch from Bug: 2570; rather than
	setting geometry of slave interp to 0x0 when Tk was loaded, it now
	does "wm withdraw .".  Both remove the main window from the
	display, but the former caused some internal structures to get
	initialized to zero, which caused crashes with some extensions.

2000-03-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/package.tcl (tclPkgUnknown): extended to allow
	recognizes changes in the auto_path while sourcing in other
	pkgIndex.tcl files

	* doc/FindExec.3: fixed doc for declaration of Tcl_FindExecutable
	[Bug: 4275]

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_TranslateFileName): Applied patch
	from Newman to significantly speedup file split/join on Windows
	(replaces regexp with custom parser).  [Bug: 2867]

	* win/README.binary: change mailing lists from @consortium.org
	to @scriptics.com [Bug: 4173]

2000-02-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/clock.test: Added test for ISO bases < 100000

	* generic/tclDate.c: (generated on Solaris)
	* generic/tclGetDate.y: Changed condition for deciding if a number
	is an ISO 8601 base from number >= 100000 to numberOfDigits >= 6.
	Previously it would fail to recognize 000000 as an ISO base.

2000-02-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Added rpm target to generate Tcl binary RPM.

	* unix/tcl.spec: RPM specification file for a Tcl binary RPM for
	Linux.

2000-02-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* changes: updated for 8.3.0 release

	* doc/load.n: added notes about dll load errors on Windows

	* unix/README:
	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): removed porting.notes and porting.old
	from distribution and CVS.  The information was very outdated.  Now
	refer to http://dev.scriptics.com/services/support/platforms.html

	* tests/unixInit.test: fixed japanese LANG encoding test [Bug: 3549]

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4: correct CFLAG_WARNING setting,
	fixed gcc config for AIX,
	added -export-dynamic to LDFLAGS for FreeBSD-3+ [Bug: 2998]

	* win/tclWinLoad.c (TclpLoadFile): improved error message for load
	failures, could perhaps be even more intelligent.

2000-02-09  Jim Ingham	 <jingham@cygnus.com>

	* mac/tclMacSock.c: Don't panic when you get an error closing an async 
	socket.	 This doesn't seem to hurt anything, and we return the error so
	the caller can do the right thing.

	New Files:
	* mac/MW_TclHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TclTestHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TclTestHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclAppleScriptHeader.h: More convenient to use .h prefix files
	in the preference panels...

	The above are curtesy of Daniel Steffen (steffen@math.mq.edu.au)

2000-02-08  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/clock.test: Added tests for "next monthname" constructs.
	* generic/tclDate.c: 
	* generic/tclGetDate.y (Message): Added a grammar rule for "next
	monthname" so that we can handle "next january" and similar
	constructs (bug #4146).

2000-02-08  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: changed all -fpic to -fPIC

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: change Tcl_GetOpenFile to use decl of 'int
	forWriting' instead of 'int write' to avoid shadowing [Bug: 4121]

	* tests/httpold.test: changed test script to source in the httpd
	server procs from httpd instead of having its own set.

	* tests/httpd: improved query support in test httpd to handle fix
	in http.tcl. [Bug: 4089 change 2000-02-01]

	* unix/README: fixed notes about --enable-shared and add note
	about --disable-shared.

2000-02-07  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/package.test: 
	* library/tclIndex: 
	* library/package.tcl: Renamed ::package namespace to ::pkg.

2000-02-03  Eric Melski <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* doc/Package.n:
	* doc/packagens.n: Renamed Package.n -> packagens.n because Windows 
	can't deal with case-sensitive names.

2000-02-02  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/regexp.test: added tests for -all and -inline switches
	* doc/regexp.n: added docs for -all and -inline switches
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd): added extra comments for
	new -all and -inline switches to regexp command

2000-02-01  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* library/init.tcl: Applied patch from rfe 1734 regarding
	auto_load errors not setting error message and errorInfo properly.

2000-02-01  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/Makefile.in (install-*): reduced verbosity of install

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_JoinPath): improved support for special
	QNX node id prefixes in pathnames [Bug: 4053]

	* library/http1.0/http.tcl:
	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: The query data POSTed was newline
	terminated when it shouldn't be altered [Bug: 4089]

2000-01-31  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/package.test: 
	* library/tclIndex: 
	* library/package.tcl: Added ::package namespace and
	::package::create function.

	* library/init.tcl: Fixed problem with auto_load and determining
	if commands were loaded.

	* library/auto.tcl: "Fixed" issues with $ in files to be auto indexed.

	* doc/Package.n: New man page for package::create function.

	* doc/pkgMkIndex.n: Added additional information.

	* doc/library.n: Added additional qualification regarding auto_mkindex.

2000-01-28  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/pkg/magicchar2.tcl: 
	* tests/autoMkindex.test: Test for auto loader fix (bug #2480).

	* library/init.tcl: auto_load was using [info commands $name] to
	determine if a given command was available; if the command name
	had * or [] it, this would fail because info commands uses
	glob-style matching.  This is fixed.  (Bug #2480).

	* tests/pkg/spacename.tcl: 
	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test: Tests for fix for bug #2360.

	* library/package.tcl: Fixed to extract only the first element of
	the list returned by auto_qualify (bug #2360).

	* tests/pkg/magicchar.tcl: 
	* tests/autoMkindex.test: Test for fix for bug #2611.

	* library/auto.tcl: Fixed the regular expression that performs $
	escaping before sourcing a file to index.  It was erroneously
	adding \ escapes even to $'s that were already escaped,
	effectively "un-escaping" those $'s.  (bug #2611).

2000-01-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/autoMkindex.test: 
	* library/auto.tcl: Applied patch (with slight modification) from
	bug #2701:  auto_mkIndex uses platform dependent file paths.
	Added test for fix.

2000-01-27  Jennifer Hom  <jenn@scriptics.com>

	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl: Changed NormalizePath to
	normalizePath and exported it as a public proc.  This proc 
	creates an absolute path given the name of the variable containing
	the path to modify.  The path is modified in place.
	* library/tcltest1.0/pkgIndex.tcl: Added normalizePath.
	* tests/all.tcl: Changed code to use normalizePath.

2000-01-27  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/pkg/samename.tcl: test file for bug #1983
	
	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test: 
	* doc/pkgMkIndex.n: 
	* library/package.tcl: Per rfe #4097, optimized creation of direct
	load packages to bypass computing the list of commands added by
	the new package.  Also made direct loading the default, and added
	a -lazy option.
	Fixed bug #1983, dealing with pkg_mkIndex incorrectly handling
	situations with two procs by the same name but in different
	namespaces (ie, foo::baz and bar::baz).

2000-01-26  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c: Undid fix for #956, which broke backwards
	compatibility.

	* doc/variable.n: 
	* doc/trace.n: 
	* doc/namespace.n: 
	* doc/info.n: Added further information about differences between
	"namespace which" and "info exists".

	* doc/SetErrno.3: Added descriptions of ErrnoId() and ErrnoMsg()
	functions.

2000-01-25  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: modified EXTRA_CFLAGS to add -DHAVE_TZSET for
	OSF1-V* and ULTRIX-4.* when not using gcc.  Also added higher min
	stack size for OSF1-V* when building with threads. [Bug: 4063]

	* generic/tclClock.c (FormatClock): inlined resultPtr, as it
	conflicted with var creation for HAVE_TZSET #def [Bug: 4063]

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsortObjCmd): fixed potential leak
	when calling lsort -command with bad command [Bug: 4067]

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_JoinPath): added support for special
	QNX node id prefixes in pathnames [Bug: 4053]

	* doc/ListObj.3: clarified Tcl_ListObjGetElements docs [Bug: 4080]

	* doc/glob.n: clarified Mac path separator determination docs.

	* win/makefile.vc: added some support for building helpfile on Windows

2000-01-23  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* library/init.tcl (auto_execok): added 'start' to list of
	recognized built-in commands for COMSPEC on NT. [Bug: 2858]

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: moved include of <utime.h> lower since some
	systems (UTS) require sys/types.h to be included first [Bug: 4031]

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (CreateSocketAddress): changed comparison
	with -1 to 0xFFFFFFFF, to ensure 32 bit comparison even on 64 bit
	systems. [Bug: 3878]

	* generic/tclFileName.c: improved guessing of path separator
	for the Mac. (Darley)

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls: moved Tcl_ProcObjCmd to stubs table [Bug: 3827]
	and removed 'register' from stub definition of
	Tcl_AppendUnicodeToObj [Bug: 4038]

2000-01-21  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* unix/mkLinks: 
	* doc/GetHostName.3: Man page for Tcl_GetHostName (bug #1817).

	* doc/lreplace.n: Corrected man page with respect to treatment of
	empty lists, and "prettied up" the page. (bug #1705).

2000-01-20  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/namespace.test: Added test for undefined variables with
	namespace which (bug #956).

	* generic/tclNamesp.c: Added check for undefined variables in
	NamespaceWhichCmd (bug #956).

	* tests/var.test: Added tests for corrected variable behavior 
	(bug #981).

	* doc/upvar.n: Expanded explanation of upvar behavior with respect to
	variable traces.  (bugs 3917 1433 2110).

	* generic/tclVar.c: Changed behavior of variable command when name
	refers to an element in an array (ie, "variable foo(x)") to always
	return an error, regardless of existance of that element in the
	array (now behavior is consistant with docs too) (bug #981).

2000-01-20  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoBodyCmd): made [info body] return a
	string if the body has been bytecompiled.
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjEx): added pedantic check for
	originating proc body of bytecompiled code, #def'd out as the
	change for [info body] should make it unnecessary

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_InitNotifier): added cast for tsdPtr

	* tests/set.test: added test for complex array elem name compiling
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSetCmd): Fixed parsing of array
	elements during compiling, and slightly optimised same [Bug: 3889]

	* doc/tclvars.n: added definitions for tcl_(non)wordchars

	* doc/vwait.n: added notes about requirement for vwait var being
	globally scoped [Bug: 3329]

	* library/word.tcl: changed tcl_(non)wordchars settings to use
	new unicode regexp char class escapes instead of char sequences

2000-01-14  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/var.test: Added a test for the array multiple delete
	protection in Tcl_UnsetVar2.

	* generic/tclVar.c: Added protection in Tcl_UnsetVar2 against
	attempts to multiply delete arrays when unsetting them (bug
	#3453).  This could happen if there was an unset trace on an array
	element and the trace proc made a global or upvar link to the
	array, and then the array was unset at the global level.  See the
	bug reference for more information.

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: New clock format format.

	* compat/strftime.c: New clock format format.

	* generic/tclGetDate.y: New clock scan format.

2000-01-13  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* changes: updated changes file to reflect 8.3b2 mods

	* README:

	* generic/regexec.c: added var initialization to prevent compiler
	warning

2000-01-13  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/cmdIL.test: Added tests for lsort -dictionary with
	characters that occur between Z and a in ASCII.

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: Modified DictionaryCompare function (used by
	lsort -dictionary) to do upper/lower case equivalency before doing
	character comparisons, instead of after.  This fixes bug #1357, in
	which lsort -dictionary [list ` AA c CC] and lsort -dictionary
	[list AA c ` CC] gave different (and both wrong) results.

2000-01-12  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* tests/clock.test: Added tests for "next <day-of-week>" and
	"<day-of-week>"
	Added tests for "monday 1 week ago", etc, from RFE #3671.

	* doc/tests/clock.test: Added numerous tests for clock scan.

	* doc/generic/tclGetDate.y: Fixed some shift/reduce conflicts in
	clock grammar.

	* doc/doc/clock.n: Added documentation for new supported clock
	scan formats and additional explanation of daylight savings time
	correction algorithm.

2000-01-12  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/file.n:
	* tests/unixFCmd.test:

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:
	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: enhanced the glob command with the new options

	TclpMatchFilesTypes, extended TclGlob and TclDoGlob and added
	GlobTypeData structure. [Bug: 2363]

1999-12-10  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/var.test:
	* generic/tclCompile.c: fixed problem where setting to {} array
	would intermittently not work. (Fontaine) [Bug: 3339]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: optimized INST_TRY_CVT_TO_NUMERIC to
	recognize boolean objects. (Spjuth) [Bug: 2815]

	* tests/info.test:
	* tests/parseOld.test:
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c: changed Tcl_UplevelObjCmd (uplevel) and
	Tcl_EvalObjCmd (eval) to use TCL_EVAL_DIRECT in the single arg
	case as well, to take advantage	of potential pure list input
	optimization.  This means that it won't get byte compiled though,
	which should be acceptable.
	* generic/tclBasic.c: made Tcl_EvalObjEx pure list object aware in
	the TCL_EVAL_DIRECT case for efficiency.
	* generic/tclUtil.c: made Tcl_ConcatObj pure list object aware,
	and return a list object in that case [Bug: 2098 2257]

	* generic/tclMain.c: changed Tcl_Main to not constantly reuse the
	commandPtr object (interactive case) as it could be shared. (Fellows)

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c: removed checking for compatible vfork
	function and use of the vfork function.  Modern VM systems rarely
	suffer any performance degradation when fork is used, and it
	solves multiple problems with vfork.  Users that still want vfork
	can add -Dfork=vfork to the compile flags. [Bug: 942 2228 1312]

1999-12-09  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* win/aclocal.m4: made it just include tcl.m4

	* win/tclWinChan.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWinInit.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinSock.c: removed all code that supported Win32s.  It

	* win/makefile.vc: removed 16 bit stuff, cleaned up.

	* win/tcl16.rc:
	* win/tclWin16.c:
	* win/winDumpExts.c: these files have been removed from the
	source tree (no longer necessary to build)

1999-12-07  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* tests/io.test: removed 'knownBug' tests that were for
	unsupported0, which is now fcopy (that already has tests)

	* mac/tclMacPort.h: added utime.h include

	* generic/tclDate.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in: fixed make gendate to swap const with CONST
	so it uses the Tcl defined CONST type [Bug: 3521]

	* generic/tclIO.c: removed panic that could occur in FlushChannel
	when a "blocking" channel would receive EAGAIN, instead treating
	it the same as non-blocking. [Bug: 3773]

	* generic/tclUtil.c: fixed Tcl_ScanCountedElement to not step
	beyond the end of the counted string [Bug: 3336]

1999-12-03  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/load.n: added note about NT's buggy handling of './' with

	[Bug: 3752]

	* tests/env.test: removed knownBug limitation from working test
	* tests/all.tcl: ensured that ::tcltest::testsDirectory would be
	set to an absolute path

	* tests/expr-old.test:
	* tests/parseExpr.test:
	* tests/string.test:
	* generic/tclGet.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:

	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: added TclCheckBadOctal routine to enhance
	error message checking for when users use invalid octal numbers
	(like 08), as well as replumbed the Expr*Funcs with a new
	VerifyExprObjType to simplify type handling. [Bug: 2467]

	* tests/expr.test:
	* generic/tclCompile.c: fixed 'bad code length' error for
	'expr + {[incr]}' case, with new test case [Bug: 3736]
	and seg fault on 'expr + {[error]}' (different cause) that
	was caused by a correct optimization that didn't correctly
	track how it was modifying the source string in the opt.
	The optimization was removed, which means that:
		expr 1 + {[string length abc]}
	will be not be compiled inline as before, but this should be
	written:
		expr {1 + [string length abc]}
	which will be compiled inline for speed.  This prevents
		expr 1 + {[mindless error]}
	from seg faulting, and only affects optimizations for
	degenerate cases [Bug: 3737]

1999-12-01  Scott Redman <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tcl.decls :
	* generic/tclMain.c :
	* unix/tclAppInit.c: 
	* win/tclAppInit.c: Added two new internal functions,
	TclSetStartupScriptFileName() and TclGetStartupScriptFileName()
	and added hooks into the main() code for supporting TclPro and
	other "big" shells more easily without requiring a copy of the
	main() code.
	
	* generic/tclEncoding.c:
	* generic/tclEvent.c:  Moved encoding-related startup code from
	tclEvent.c into the more appropriate tclEncoding.c.

	correctly handles resetting translation and encoding.

	* generic/tclLoad.c: #def'd out the unloading of DLLs at finalize
	time for Unix in TclFinalizeLoad. [Bug: 2560 3373]  Should be
	parametrized to allow for user to specify unload or not.

	* win/tclWinTime.c: fixed handling of %Z on NT for time zones
	that don't have DST.

	went to stdout instead of the specified output file in some
	cases.

1999-11-19  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/http.n:
	* library/http2.1/http.tcl:

	length to Tcl_SetUnicodeObj, et al handling routines. [Bug: 3380]

	* doc/scan.n:
	* tests/scan.test:
	* generic/tclScan.c: finished support for inline scan by
	supporting XPG identifiers.

	* doc/http.n:
	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: added register and unregister
	commands to http:: package (better support for tls/SSL),
	as well as -type argument to http::geturl. [RFE: 2617]

	* generic/tclBasic.c: removed extra decr of numLevels in

	* doc/tcltest.n: fixed minor example errors [Bug: 3551]

1999-11-17 Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>
	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Correctly fixed the -timeout
	problem mentioned in the 10-29 change.  Also added error
	handling for failed writes on the socket during the protocol.

1999-11-09  Jeff Hobbs  <hobbs@scriptics.com>

	* doc/open.n: corrected docs for 'a' open mode.

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: changed Tcl_Alloc to ckalloc

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c: rolled back changes from 1999-10-29

	possible unbalanced open brace in a comment

	* library/init.tcl: removed the installed binary directory from

	* tools/tcl.wse.in: updated to 8.3a1, fixed install of twind.tcl
	and koi8-r.enc files

	* unix/tcl.m4: added recognition of pthreads library for AIX

1999-10-29  Brent Welch <welch@scriptics.com>
	* generic/tclInt.h: Modified the TclNewObj and TclDecrRefCount
	in two ways.  First, in the case of TCL_THREADS, we do not use
	the special Tcl_Obj allocator because that is a source of 
	lock contention.  Second, general code cleanup to eliminate
	duplicated code. In particular, TclDecrRefCount now uses
	TclFreeObj instead of duplicating that code, so it is now
	identical to Tcl_DecrRefCount.

	* generic/tclObj.c: Changed Tcl_NewObj so it uses the
	TclNewObj macro instead of duplicating the code.  Adjusted
	TclFreeObj so it understands the TCL_THREADS case described
	above.

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: Fixed a bug in the handling of
	the state(status) variable when the -timeout flag is specified.
	Previously it was possible to leave the status undefined
	instead of empty, which caused errors in http::status

	* tests/scan.test:
	* generic/tclScan.c: added support for use of inline scan,
	XPG3 currently not included

	* tests/set.test:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: fixed improper bytecode handling of
	'eval {set array($unknownvar) 5}' (also for incr) [Bug: 3184]

	* win/tclWinTest.c: added testvolumetype command, as atime is
	completely ignored for Windows FAT file systems

	when indexing into one (test case string-5.16) [Bug: 2871]

	* library/http2.1/http.tcl: protected gets with catch [Bug: 2665]

1999-10-19  Jennifer Hom  <jenn@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test:
	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl: Removed the extra return at the
	end of the tcltest.tcl file, added version information about tcl.

	Applied patches sent in by Andreas Kupries to add helper procs for
	debug output, add 3 new flags (-testsdir, -load, -loadfile), and
	internally refactors common code for dealing with paths into
	separate procedures. [Bug: 2838, 2842]

	Merged code from core-8-2-1 branch that changes the checks for the
	value of tcl_interactive to also incorporate a check for the
	existence of the variable.

	* tests/tcltest.test:
	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl: Exit with non-zero status if

1999-07-29    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: Allow tcl to open CON and NUL, even for std
	channels.  Checking for bad/unusable std channels was moved to Tk
	since its only purpose was to check whether to use the Tk Console
	Window for the std channels.  [Bug: 2393 2392 2209 2458]

	* unix/mkLinks.tcl: Applied patch to avoid linking pack.n to

	to ready Tcl/Tk Version 8.2.

1999-07-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test:  Need to close the new core file, there
	seems to be a hang in threaded WinNT if the file isn't closed.
	Open issue, need to fix that hang.

	* tests/httpold.test:  Add time delay in response from Http server
	so that test cases can properly detect timeout conditions with
	threads enabled on multi-CPU WinNT.

	* tests/winFCmd.test:  Test case winFcmd-1.33 was looking for
	c:\windows, which may not exist.  Instead, create a new directory
	on c:\ and use it for the test.

	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinSock.c:  Fix terminating helper threads by holding any
	mutexes from the primary thread while waiting for the helper
	thread to terminate.  Without these changes, the test suite hangs
	on WinNT with 2 CPUs and threads enabled.  Open issue, seems to be
	a sporadic hang on dual CPU systems still (very rare).

1999-07-26  Jennifer Hom  <jenn@scriptics.com>

	* tests/var.test:
	* generic/tclVar.c:  Fixed bug that caused a seg. fault when using
	"array set a(b) {}", which is a bad array name anyway.  Now the

	* doc/Utf.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclUtf.c: Changed function declarations in
	non-platform-specific public APIs to use "unsigned long" instead of
	"size_t", which may not be defined on certain compilers (rather
	than include sys/types.h, which may not exist).
	
	* unix/Makefile.in: Added the Windows configure script to the
	distribution file list, already shipping configure.in and the .m4
	files, but needed the configure script itself.
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Changed version number of DDE package in VC++
	makefile to use 1.1 instead of 1.0.

	* doc/open.n: Added documentation of \\.\comX notation for opening
	serial ports on Windows (alternative to comX:).

	case as well.
	
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Modified 8.1.0 version of the Win32 socket
	driver to move the handling of the socket event window in a
	separate thread.  It also turned out that Win95 & Win98 were, in
	some cases, getting multiple FD_ACCEPTs but only handling one.
	Added a count for the FD_ACCEPT to take care of this.  Tested on
	NT4 SP3, NT4 SP4, Win95, and Win98.
	[Bug: 2178 2256 2259 2329 2323 2355]

1999-07-20  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclInitScript.h: 
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: merged code with 8.0.5.  We now use an
	intermediate global tcl var "tclDefaultLibrary" to keep the
	"tcl_library" var from being set by the default value in the
	Makefile.  Also fixed a bug in which caused the value of
	TCL_LIBRARY env var to be ignored.
	* unix/tclWinInit.c: just updated some comments.

1999-07-19  Melissa Hirschl  <hershey@matisse.scriptics.com>

	up wording, fixed changebars, made two examples easier to read.

1999-07-11    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Since the makefile.vc should continue to work
	while we're working out bugs/issues in the new TEA-style
	autoconf/configure/gmake build mechanism for Windows, the version
	numbers of the Tcl libraries need to remain in sync.  Modified the
	version numbers in the makefile to reflect the change to 8.2b1.

1999-07-09    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/configure.in: Eval DLLSUFFIX, LIBSUFFIX, and EXESUFFIX in
	the configure script so that substitutions get expanded before
	being placed in the Makefile.  The "d" portion for debug libraries
	and DLLs was not being set properly.
	
1999-07-08    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c:  New implementation of serial port driver
	from Rolf Shroedter (Rolf.Schroedter@dlr.de) that allows more than
	one byte to be read from the port.  Implemented using polling
	instead of threads, there is a max. 10ms latency between checking the
	port for file events.  [Bug: 1980 2217]

1999-07-06    <welch@scriptics.com>

	* library/http2.0/http.tcl: Fixed the -timeout option so it
	handles timeouts that occur during connection attempts to

	calls at runtime  The Xt notifier and test program use this hook.

1999-07-03    <welch@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclParse.c: Changed parsing of variable names to
	allow empty array names.  Now "$(foo)" is a variable reference!
	Previous you had to use something like $::(foo), which is slower.
	This change is requested by Jean-Luc Fontaine for his STOOOP
	package.

1999-07-01    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:

	match and all.tcl was modified to use the new functionality
	instead of implementing -file itself. 

1999-06-28    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c:
	* doc/GetIndex.3:
	* tests/binary.test:
	* tests/winDde.test: Applied patch from Peter Hardie (with
	changes) to fix problem with Tcl_GetIndexFromObj() when the key
	being passed is the empty string.  It used to match "" and return
	TCL_OK, but it should have returned TCL_ERROR instead.  Added test
	case to "binary" and "dde" commands to check the behavior.  Added
	documentation note as well.

1999-06-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinDde.c: Applied patch from Peter Hardie to add poke
	command to dde.  Also rev'd version of dde package to 1.1.
	[Bug: 1738]

	* win/Makefile.in:
	* library/tcltest1.0/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/tcltest1.0/tcltest.tcl:
	* library/tcltest1.0: Added initial implementation of the Tcl test
	harness package.  This package was based on the defs.tcl file that
	was part of the tests directory. Reversed the way that tests were
	evaluated to fix a problem with false passes.

	* doc/tcltest.n: Added documentation for the tcltest package.

	* tests/README:
	* tests/defs.tcl:
	* tests/all.tcl: Modified all test files (tests/*.test) and
	all.tcl to use the new tcltest package and removed references to

	* generic/tclRegexp.c: 
	* generic/tcl.h: 
	* generic/tcl.decls: Renamed Tcl_RegExpMatchObj to

	equivalent to Tcl_RegExpMatch.  Added public macros for the regexp
	compile/execute flags.  Changed to store either an object pointer
	or a string pointer in the TclRegexp structure.  Changed to avoid
	adding a reference to the object or copying the string.

	* generic/regcomp.c: lint

	* tests/reg.test: 
	* generic/regex.h: 
	* generic/regc_lex.c: Added REG_BOSONLY flag to allow Expect to
	iterate through a string an only find matches that start at the

1999-06-16    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/execute.test:
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Fixed crash caused by
	a bug in INST_LOAD_SCALAR1 where the scalar index was read as
	a signed 1 byte value instead of unsigned.  [Bug: 2243]

1999-06-08    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Rolled back to the 8.1.0 implementation
	because of serious problems with the new driver.  Basically no
	incoming socket connections would be reported to a server port.
	The 8.1.1 code needs to be redesigned and fixed correctly.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): optimized the string
	index, string length, string range, and append command in cases
	where the object's internal rep is a bytearray.  Objects with
	other internal reps are converted to have the new unicode internal
	rep.  

	* unix/Makefile.in:

	* win/Makefile.vc: 
	* tests/unicode.test:

	an object has.

1999-06-04    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/configure.in:

1999-05-26    <redman@scriptic.com>

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c: Fixed race condition in testthread
	code that showed up in the WinNT test suite intermittently.

1999-05-20    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* library/init.tcl: Add the directory where the executable is, and
	the ../lib directory relative to that, to the auto_path variable.
	
1999-05-19    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	Merged in various changes submitted by Jeff Hobbs:
	
	* generic/tcl.decls: 
	* generic/tclUtf.c: Added Tcl_UniCharIs* functions for control,
	graph, print, and punct classes.

	* generic/tclUtil.c:

	support case-insensitive globbing.
	
	* doc/string.n: 
	* unix/mkLinks: 
	* tests/string.test: 
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Added additional character class tests,
	added -nocase switch to "string match", changed string first/last
	to use offsets.

1999-05-19    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: Add extern "C" block around entire header file for
	C++ compilers to fix linkage issues.  Submitted by Don Porter and
	Paul Duffin.

	* generic/tclRegexp.c: Fix bug when the regexp cache is empty
	and an empty pattern is used in regexp ( such as {} or "" ).

1999-05-18    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: Modified initialization code to avoid
	inherenting closed or invalid channels.  If the standard input is
	anything other than a console, file, serial port, or pipe, then we
	fall back to the standard Tk window console.

1999-05-14    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_ForObjCmd): Fixed crash caused by
	failure to reset the result before evaluating the test
	expression. 

1999-05-14    <surles@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp): Added introspection
	variable for threaded interps.  If the interp was compiled with
	threads enabled, the tcl_platform(threaded) variable will exist.

1999-05-14    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclDate.c: Applied patch to fix 100-year and 400-year
	boundaries in leap year code, from Isaac Hollander.  [Bug: 2066]

1999-05-13    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/tclAppInit.c: Minor cleanup related to Xt notifier.
	
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): Tcl now looks for
	an encoding subfield in the LANG/LC_ALL variables in cases where
	the locale is not found in the locale table.  Ensure that
	setlocale() is called at least once so X11 will initialize
	properly.  Also, forces the LC_NUMERIC locale to be "C" so numeric
	processing in scripts is not affected by the current locale
	setting. [Bug: 1989]

	* generic/tclRegexp.c: Increased per-thread regexp cache to 30
	slots.  This seems to be about the right number for larger
	applications like exmh.  [Bug: 1063]

1999-05-12    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* doc/tclsh.1: Updated references to rc script names to accurately
	reflect the platform differences on Windows.

	* tests/regexp.test: 
	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* generic/tclBasic.c: 
	* generic/tclRegexp.h:
	* generic/tclRegexp.c: Replaced the per-interpreter regexp cache
	with a per-thread cache.  Changed the Regexp object to take
	advantage of this extra cache.  Added a reference count to the
	TclRegexp type so regexps can be shared by multiple objects.
	Removed the per-interp regexp cache from the interpreter.  Now
	regexps can be used with no need for an interpreter. [Bug: 1063]

	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpSetVariables): Avoid calling GetUserName
	if the value can be determined from the USERNAME environment
	variable.  GetUserName is very slow.

1999-05-07    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/winDumpExts.c: 
	* win/makefile.vc: Removed incorrect patch. [Bug: 1998]
	
	* generic/tcl.decls: Replaced const with CONST.

	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_AppendResultVA): 
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_AppendStringsToObjVA): Fixed to copy
	arglist using memcpy instead of assignment so it works properly on
	OS/390. [Bug: 1997]

	* generic/tclLoadNone.c: Updated to use current interfaces, added
	TclpUnloadFile. [Bug: 2003]

	* win/winDumpExts.c: 
	* win/makefile.vc: Changed to emit library name in defs
	file. [Bug: 1998]

	* unix/configure.in: Added fix for OS/390. [Bug: 1976]

1999-05-06    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/string.test: 
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: 
	* doc/string.n: Fixed bug in string equal/compare code when using
	-length option.  Cleaned up docs a bit more.

	* tests/http.test: Unset "data" array before running tests to
	avoid failures due to previous tests.

	* generic/tclUtil.c: 
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Replaced "string icompare/iequal" with
	-nocase and -length switches to "string compare/equal".  Added a
	-nocase option to "string map".  Changed index syntax to allow
	integer or end?-integer? instead of a full expression.  This is
	much simpler with safeTcl scripts since it avoids double
	substitution issues.

	* doc/Utf.3: 
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tclDecls.h: 
	* generic/tclUtf.c:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Added Tcl_UtfNcmp and Tcl_UtfNcasecmp.

1999-05-05    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Added encoding directory to install-libraries

	* doc/string.n: 
	* tests/cmdMZ.test: 
	* tests/string.test: 
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): Changed "string length"
	to avoid regenerating the string rep of a ByteArray object.

	* tests/cmdMZ.test: 
	* tests/error.test: 
	* tests/lindex.test:

	* tests/lreplace.test: 
	* tests/string.test: 
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): 
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetIntForIndex): Applied Jeff Hobbs's
	string patch which includes the following changes [Bug: 1845]:
	
	    - string compare now takes optional length arg (for strncmp
		behavior)
                            
            - added string equal (just a few lines of code blended
                in with string compare)
            
            - added string icompare/iequal for case-insensitive comparisons
            
            - string index's index can now be ?end[+-]?expression
                I made this change in the private TclGetIntForIndex,
                which means that the list commands also benefit, as
                well as string range, et al.
            
            - added [string repeat string count]
                Repeats given string  number of times
            
            - added string replace, string equiv to lreplace
              (quasi opposite of string range):
                        string replace first last ?string?
                Example of use, replacing end of string with ...
                should the string be more than 16 chars long:
                        string replace $string 16 end "..."
                This just returns the string len < 16, so it
                will only affect the long strings.
            
            - added optional first and last args to string to*
                This allows you to just affect certain regions of
                a string with the command (like just capping the
                first letter).  I found the original totitle to
                be too draconian to be useful.
            
            - added [string map charMap string]
                where charMap is a {from to from to} list that equates to
                what one might get from [array get].  Each  and 
                can be multiple chars (or none at all).  For Tcl/CGI users,
                this is a MAJOR speed booster.
	
	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_ParseCommand): Changed to avoid
	modifying eval'ed strings that are already null terminated.
	[Bug: 1793] 

	* tests/binary.test: 
	* generic/tclBinary.c (DupByteArrayInternalRep): Fixed bug where
	type was not being set in duplicated object. [Bug: 1975, 2047]

1999-04-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>
	
	* Changed version to 8.1.1.
	
1999-04-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Merged changes from 8.1.0 branch:

	* generic/tclParse.c: Fixed memory leak in CommandComplete.

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: 
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: 
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: 
	* generic/tclDecls.h: 
	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Added 'extern "C" {}' block around the stub
	table pointer declaration so the stub library can be used from
	C++. [Bug: 1934]

	* Lots of documentation and other release engineering fixes.

1999-04-28    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* mac/tclMacResource.c: 
	* generic/tclListObj.c: 
	* generic/tclObj.c: 
	* generic/tclStringObj.c: Changed to avoid freeing the string
	representation before freeing the internal rep.  This helps with
	debugging since the string rep will still be valid when the free
	proc is invoked.

1999-04-27    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclHideLiteral): Fixed so hidden literals
	get duplicated to avoid accidental sharing in the global object
	table. 

1999-04-23    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclStubInit.c: 
	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Changed to avoid the need for forward
	declarations in stub initializers.

1999-04-23    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* library/encoding/koi8-r.enc:
	* tools/encoding/koi8-r.txt: Added support for the koi8-r Cyrillic
	encoding. [Bug: 1771]

1999-04-22    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: Changed uses of "try" to "__try", since that
	is the actual keyword.  This eliminates the need for some -D flags
	from the makefile.

	* generic/tclPort.h: Added include of tcl.h since it defines
	various Windows macros that are needed before deciding which
	platform porting file to use.

	* generic/tclEvent.c: lint

	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitPlatform): Added call to TclWinInit
	when building a static library since DllMain will not be invoked.
	This could break old code that explicitly called TclWinInit, but
	should be simpler in the long run.

1999-04-22  Scott Stanton  <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* generic/tclInt.decls: 
	* generic/tclCompile.c: Added TclSetByteCodeFromAny that takes a
	hook procedure to invoke after compilation but before the byte
	codes are emitted.  This makes it possible to do postprocessing on
	the compiled byte codes before the ByteCode is generated.

	* generic/tclLiteral.c: Added TclHideLiteral and TclAddLiteralObj
	to make it possible to create local unshared literal objects.
	
	* win/tclWinInit.c:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: Changed initial search path to match that
	found used by tcl_findLibrary.

1999-04-22    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h:
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Added code to use WinSock 2.0 API on NT to
	avoid creating a window to handle sockets.  API not available on
	Win95 and needs to be fixed on Win98, until then continue to use
	the older (window-based) scheme on those two OSes.
	
1999-04-15    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* Merged 8.1 back into the main trunk

	* library/encoding/gb2312.enc:
	* library/encoding/euc-cn.enc:
	* tools/encoding/gb2312.txt:
	* tools/encoding/cp950.txt:
	* tools/encoding/Makefile: Restored the double byte definition of
	GB2312 and added the EUC-CN encoding.  EUC-CN is a variant of
	GB2312 that shifts the characters into bytes with the high bit set
	and includes ASCII as a subset. [Bug: 632]

1999-04-13    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Apply patch to allow write access to a socket
	if FD_WRITE is sent but FD_CONNECT is not.  Some strange problem
	with either Win32 or a socket driver.  [Bug: 1664 1776]

1999-04-09    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: Fixed notifier deadlock situation when the
	pipe used to talk back notifier thread is filled with data.  When
	calling the write() function to feed data down that pipe, unlock
	the notifierMutex to allow the notifier to wake up again.  Found
	as a result of the focus.test for Tk hanging. [Bug: 1700]

1999-04-06    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: Fixed hang in tests when built with thread
	support.

	enough for events to arrive.

	* tests/unixInit.test: Fixed race condition in test.
	
	* tests/unixInit.test: 
	* tests/fileName.test: Minor test nits.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): Fixed bad initial
	encoding string.

1999-04-06    <surles@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclVar.c: 
	* generic/tclEnv.c: Moved the "array set" C level code into a
	common routine (TclArraySet).  The TclSetupEnv routine now uses
	this API to create an env array w/ no elements.

	* generic/tclEnv.c:
	* generic/tclWinInit.h:
	* generic/tclUnixInit.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h: Made the Env module I18N compliant.  Changed the
	FindVariable routine to TclpFindVariable, that now does a case
	insensitive string comparison on Windows, and not on UNIX. [Bug:
	1299, 1500]

1999-04-05    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/io.test: Minor test cleanup.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (Tcl_CreateEncoding): Minor lint to make
	it easier to compile on Digital-unix. [Bug: 1659]

	* unix/configure.in: 
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: Applied patch for OS/390 to handle lack of
	sys/param.h. [Bug: 1725]

	* unix/configure.in: Fixed BSD/OS 4.* configuration to support
	shared libraries properly. [Bug: 1730]
	
1999-04-05    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclUtil.c: Added more functions to the Tcl stubs table,
	including all Tcl_ functions not already in it (except Cmd
	functions) and Tcl_GetCwd() and Tcl_Chdir() (new functions).
	
	* tests/safe.test:
	* doc/safe.n:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* library/safe.tcl: The encoding command is not safe as-is, so
	create a safe alias to mask out the "encoding system <name>" but
	allow all other uses including "encoding system". Added test cases
	and updated the man page for Safe Tcl.

1999-04-05    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/winTime.test: 
	* win/tclWinTime.c: Fixed crash in clock command that occurred
	when manipulating negative time values in timezones east of
	GMT. [Bug: 1142, 1458]
	
	* tests/platform.test: 
	* tests/fileName.test: Fixed broken tests.
	
	* generic/tclFileName.c: Moved global regexps into thread local
	storage.

	* tests/socket.test: Changed so tests don't reuse sockets,
	since Windows is slow to release sockets.

	* win/tclWinConsole.c: 
	* win/tclWinPipe.c: 
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Fixed race condition where background
	threads were terminated while they still held a lock in the
	notifier. 

1999-04-02    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/http.test: Fixed bad test initialization code.

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (ThreadExitProc): Fixed bug where static
	memory was being returned instead of a dynamically allocated
	result in error cases.

1999-04-02    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* doc/dde.n:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* win/tclWinDde.c:  Add new DDE package, code removed from Tk now
	separated into its own package.  Changed DDE-based send code into
	"dde eval" command.  Can be loaded into tclsh (not just wish).
	Windows only.

	public. The following functions were made public and added to the
	stubs table: 
		Tcl_UtfToUniCharDString, Tcl_UniCharToUtfDString,
		Tcl_UniCharLen, Tcl_UniCharNcmp, Tcl_UniCharIsAlnum,
		Tcl_UniCharIsAlpha, Tcl_UniCharIsDigit, Tcl_UniCharIsLower,

1999-04-01    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/registry.test: 
	* win/tclWinReg.c: Internationalized the registry code.  It now
	uses Unicode interfaces on NT. [Bug: 1197]

	* tests/parse.test: 
	* generic/tclParse.c: Fixed crash due to multiple frees in parser
	during error cleanup when parsing commands with more tokens than
	will fit in the static area of the parse structure. [Bug: 1681]

	* generic/tclInt.h: Removed duplicate declarations.

	* generic/tclInt.decls: 
	* generic/tcl.decls: Added Tcl_WinUtfToTChar and Tcl_WinTCharToUtf

	multiple symbol definition problem.  Now, even Tcl includes a copy
	of the Tcl stub library.  Also fixed TCL_MEM_DEBUG mode (for Tk).

1999-03-31    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c: WinNT has a bug when reading a single
	character from the console.  Rewrote the code for the console to
	read an entire line at a time using the reader thread.

1999-03-30    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Removed trailing backslash that broke the
	"depend" target.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): Changed to avoid
	calling setlocale().  We now look directly at env(LANG) and
	env(LC_CTYPE) instead. [Bug: 1636]

	* generic/tclFileName.c: 
	* generic/tclDecls.h: 
	* generic/tcl.decls: Removed CONST from Tcl_JoinPath and
	Tcl_TranslateFileName because it changes the signature of
	Tcl_JoinPath in an incompatible manner.

	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* generic/tclLoad.c (TclFinalizeLoad): 
	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Defer unloading of loadable
	modules until all exit handlers have been invoked.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: Removed the stub functions and
	changed the stub macros to just use the name without params. Pass
	&tclStubs into the interp (don't use tclStubsPtr because of
	collisions with the stubs on Solaris).
	
1999-03-27    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/makefile.bc: Removed makefile for Borland compiler, no
	longer supported.

1999-03-26    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c:
	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c: Don't close the Win32 handle for a channel if
	it's a stdio handle (GetStdHandle()) during shutdown of a thread
	to prevent it from destroying the stdio of other threads.

1999-03-26    <suresh@scriptics.com>

	* unix/configure.in
	--nameble-shared is now the default and build Tcl as a shared
	library; specify --disable-shared to build a static Tcl library
	and shell.

1999-03-25    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/interp.test: 
	* generic/tclInterp.c (AliasObjCmd): Changed so aliases are
	invoked at current scope in the target interpreter instead of at
	the global scope.  This was an incompatibility introduced in 8.1
	that is being removed. [Bug: 1153, 1556]
	
	* library/encoding/big5.enc:
	* library/encoding/gb2312.enc:
	* tools/encoding/big5.enc:
	* tools/encoding/gb2312.enc: Added ASCII to big5 and gb2312
	encodings. [Bug: 632]
	
	* generic/tclPkg.c (Tcl_PkgRequireEx): Fixed broken clientData
	initialization in package code.

	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): Added tcl.decls and tclInt.decls to
	source distribution. [Bug: 1571]

	* doc/Thread.3: Updated documentation of Tcl_MutexLock to indicate
	that the recursive locking behavior is undefined.  On Windows, it
	does not block, on Unix it deadlocks. [Bug: 1275]

1999-03-24    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/execute.test: 
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Fixed expression code
	that incorrectly returned floating point values for integers if
	the internal rep happened to be a double.  Now we check to see if
	the object has a string rep that looks like an integer before
	using the double internal rep. [Bug: 1516]

1999-03-24    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclAlloc.c:
	* generic/tclEncoding.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* unix/tclUnixTime.c:
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Fixed compilation warnings/errors for VC++
	5.0 and 6.0 and HP-UX native compiler without -Aa or -Ae. 
	[Bug: 1323 1518 1324 1583 1585 1586]

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Make sockets thread-safe on Windows. The
	current implementation uses windows to handle events on the
	socket, one for each thread (thread local storage). Previously,
	there was only one window shared between threads, which didn't
	work. [Bug: 1326]

1999-03-23    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tools/tcl.wse: Fixed file association to look in the right place
	for the wish icon. [Bug: 1544]

	* tests/winNotify.test: 
	* tests/ioCmd.test: 
	* tests/event.test: Changed to use new style conditionals.

	* tests/encoding.test: Fixed nonportable test.

	* unix/dltest/configure.in: 
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Added missing DBGX macros. [Bug: 1564]

	* tests/winNotify.test: 
	* mac/tclMacNotify.c: 
	* win/tclWinNotify.c: 
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* generic/tclNotify.c: Added a new Tcl_ServiceModeHook interface
	that is invoked whenever the service mode changes.  This is needed
	to allow the Windows notifier to create a communication window the
	first time Tcl is about to enter an external modal event loop
	instead of at startup time.  This will avoid the various problems
	that people have been seeing where the system hangs when tclsh
	is running outside of the event loop. [Bug: 783]

	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* generic/tcl.decls: Renamed TclpAlertNotifier back to
	Tcl_AlertNotifier since it is part of the public notifier driver
	API.

1999-03-23    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Fixed problem with fileevent on the serial
	port and nonblocking mode.  Gets no longer hangs, fileevents fire
	whenever there is any character data on the port.
	
	* tests/winConsole.test:
	* win/tclWinConsole.c: Fixed problem with fileevents and gets from
	a console stdin.  Previously, fileevents were firing before an
	entire line was available for reading, which meant that when you
	did a gets or read, it blocked (even in nonblocking mode). Now, it
	should work the same as Unix: fileevents fire when an entire line
	is ready, and gets and read do not block in non-blocking mode.
	Added an interactive test case to check for this.

1999-03-22    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* tests/reg.test: 
	* generic/regc_color.c: Applied regexp bug fix from Henry Spencer.

1999-03-19    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: Fixed the initialization of an array so that
 	the Sun 5.0 C compiler wouldn't complain.

	* unix/configure.in: Added support for --enable-64bit.  For now,
 	this is only supported on Solaris 7 64bit (SunOS 5.7) using the Sun 
	compiler (not gcc).
	
1999-03-18    <stanton@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c (TclpOpenFileChannel, Tcl_MakeFileChannel):
	Changed to only test for console or comm handles when the type is
	FILE_TYPE_CHAR to avoid useless tests on simple files.  Also
	reordered tests so consoles are tested first as this is more
	common.

	* win/makefile.vc: Regularized usage of mkd and rmd and rm.

	* library/encoding/shiftjis.enc: 
	* tools/encoding/shiftjis.txt: Missing/incorrect characters in
	shift-jis table. [Bug: 1008, 1526]

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tcl.decls: Eliminated use of "string" and "list" from
	argument lists to avoid conflicts with C++ STL. [Bug: 1181]

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchFiles): Changed to ignore the
	FS_CASE_IS_PRESERVED bit and always return exactly what we get
	from the system.

1999-03-17    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/README.binary: 
	* win/README: 
	* unix/configure.in: 
	* generic/tcl.h: 
	* README: Updated version to 8.1b3.

1999-03-14    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c: 
	* win/tclWinPipe.c: 
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Changed so channel drivers wait for the
	reader/writer threads to exit before returning during a close
	operation.  This ensures that the main thread is the last thread
	to exit, so the process return value is set properly.

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: 
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: 
	* generic/tclIntPlatStubs.c: 
	* generic/tclIntStubs.c: 
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: 
	* generic/tclPlatStubs.c: 
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: 
	* generic/tclStubs.c: Fixed bad eol characters.
	
	* generic/tclInt.decls: Changed "const" to "CONST" in
	declarations for better portability.

	* generic/tcl.decls: Renamed panic and panicVA to Tcl_Panic and
	Tcl_PanicVA in the stub files.

	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_MakeSafe): Remove tcl_platform(user)
	from safe interps.

1999-03-11    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in: Include compat files in the stub library in
	addition to the main library.  Compat files are now built for
	dynamic use in all cases.
	
	* generic/tcl.h: Changed magic number so it doesn't match the plus
	patch, at Jan's request.
	
	* unix/tclConfig.sh.in:
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in:
	* unix/dltest/configure.in:

	stubs library.

1999-03-10    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tcl.h: 
	* generic/tcl.decls: Changed Tcl_ReleaseType from an enum to
	macros so it can be used in .rc files.
	Added Tcl_GetString.

	* mac/tclMacNotify.c:
	* generic/tclNotify.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* win/tclWinNotify.c: 
	* generic/tcl.h: Renamed Tcl_AlertNotifier to TclpAlertNotifier.

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Added TclWinAddProcess to make it possible
	for expect to use Tcl_WaitForPid().  This patch is from Gordon
	Chaffee. 

	* mac/tclMacPort.h: 
	* win/tclWinInit.c: 
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: 
	* generic/tclAsync.c: Added TclpAsyncMark to fix bug in async
	handling on Windows where async events don't wake up the event
	loop.  This patch comes from Gordon Chaffee.

	* generic/tcl.decls: Fixed declarations of reserved slots.
	
1999-03-10    <redman@scriptic.com>

	* generic/tclCompile.h: Ensure that the ByteCode struct is binary
	compatible with the version in 8.0.6.

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c: Add Tcl_GetVersion() function to the public
	C API to allow programs to check the version number of the Tcl
	library at runtime.  Also added an enum to clarify the release
	level (alpha, beta, final).

1999-03-09    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Integrated changes from Tcl 8.0 including:
		stubs mechanism
		configure patches from Jan Nijtmans

	storage.

1999-03-08    <stanton@GASPODE>
	
	* generic/tcl.h: Moved Tcl_Mutex, etc. macros above the inclusion
	of tclDecls.h to avoid macro conflicts.

	* win/tclWinPort.h: Added Tcl stubs implementation.  There are
	now two new macros USE_TCL_STUBS and USE_TCL_STUB_PROCS that
	enable use of stubs and disable stub macros respectively.  All of
	the public and private function declarations from tcl.h and
	tclInt.h have moved into the *.decls files and the *Stubs.c and
	*Decls.h files are generated using the genStubs.tcl script.

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in: 
	* unix/ldAix: Enhanced AIX shared library support.

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Removed a bunch of extraneous PASCAL FAR
	attributes from internal functions.

	* win/tclWinReg.c: Changed registry package to use stubs mechanism
	so it no longer depends on the specific version of Tcl.

	* doc/AddErrInfo.3: 
	* doc/Eval.3: 
	* doc/PkgRequire.3: 
	* doc/SetResult.3:

	functions so they can be invoked from the stub functions.

	* doc/package.n: 
	* doc/PkgRequire.3: 
	* generic/tclPkg.c: Added Tcl_PkgProvideEx, Tcl_RequireEx,
	Tcl_PresentEx, and Tcl_PkgPresent.  Added "package present"
	command.

	* generic/tclFileName.c: 
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: 
	* mac/tclMacShLib.exp: 
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: 
	* win/tclWinFile.c: Changed so TclGetUserHome is defined on
	all platforms, even though it is currently a noop on mac and
	windows, and renamed it to TclpGetUserHome.

	* generic/tclPanic.c:
	* generic/panic.c: Renamed panic to Tcl_Panic.
	
1999-02-25    <redman@scriptics.com>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c: New code to properly deal with fileevents
	and nonblocking mode on consoles.
	
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: New code to properly deal with fileevents
	and nonblocking mode on serial ports.

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: 
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Exported functions to allow creation of pipe
	channels from tclWinChan.c

	* win/tclWinChan.c: Check the type of a channel, including for the
	standard (stdin/stdout/stderr), and use the correct channel type
	to create the channel (file, serial, console, or pipe).

	* mac/README: Updated version numbers to 8.1b2.

1999-02-10    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/auto.tcl: Fixed auto_mkindex so it handles .tbc files.
	Did some general cleanup to handle bad eval statements that didn't
	use "list".

	* unix/mkLinks:
	* doc/SetVar.3:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclVar.c: Restored Tcl_ObjGetVar2 and Tcl_ObjSetVar2
	from 8.0. Renamed Tcl_Get/SetObjVar2 to Tcl_GetVar2Ex and
	Tcl_SetVar2Ex.

1999-02-10    <stanton@GASPODE>

	INTEGRATED PATCHES FROM 8.0.5b2: 

	* test/winPipe.test: Changed to remove echoArgs.tcl temporary file
	when done.
	
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclGetExtension): Changed behavior so the
	split happens at the last period in the name instead of the first
	period of the last run of periods.  So, "foo..o" is split into
	"foo." and ".o" now. [Bug: 1126]
	
	* win/makefile.vc: Added better support for paths with spaces in
	the name. Added .lib and support .dlls to the install-binaries
	target.  Added generate of a pkgIndex.tcl script to the
	install-libraries target.

	* win/tclAppInit.c: 
	* unix/tclAppInit.c: 
	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c: 
	* generic/tclTest.c: Changed some EXTERN declarations to extern
	since they are not defining exported interfaces.  This avoids
	generating useless declspec() attributes and makes the windows
	makefile simpler.

	* generic/tcl.h: Moved Tcl_AppInit declaration to end and cleared
	out TCL_STORAGE_CLASS so it is not declared with a declspec().

	* tests/interp.test:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (DeleteAlias): Changed to use
	Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken so we handle renames properly. This
	avoids senseless panic. [Bug: 736]

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: 
	* win/tclWinSock.c: 
	* doc/socket.n: Applied Gordon Chaffee's patch to handle failures
	during asynchronous socket connection operations.  This adds a new
	"-error" fconfgure option to socket channels. [Bug: 893]

	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: 
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: 
	* generic/tclBasic.c: 
	* generic/tclVar.c: Applied patch from Viktor Dukhovni to
	rationalize TCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG behavior when creating variables.
	
	* generic/tclVar.c: Fixed bug in namespace tail computation.
	Fixed bug where upvar could resurrect a namespace variable whose
	namespace had been deleted.

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileExprCmd): Eliminated yet another
	bogus optimization in expression compilation.

	* unix/configure.in: Added branch for BSD/OS-4* to shared library
	case statement. [Bug: 975]
	Fixed to correctly handle IRIX 6.5 n32 library support. [Bug: 1117]
	
	* win/winDumpExts.c: Patched to be pickier about stripping
	@'s. [Bug: 920]

	* library/http2.0/http.tcl: Added catch around eof test in
	CopyDone since the user may have already called http::reset.
	[Bug: 1108] 

	* unix/configure.in: Changed Linux and IRIX to set SHLIB_LIBS to
	LIBS so shared libraries are linked with the system
	libraries. [Bug: 1018]

	* generic/tclCompile.c (CompileExprWord): Fixed exception stack
	overflow bug caused by missing statement. [Bug: 928]

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c: 
	* generic/tclBasic.c: Objectified the "open" command. [Bug: 1113] 

	* generic/tclPosixStr.c (Tcl_ErrnoId, Tcl_ErrnoMsg): When using
	egcs, ENOTSUP and EOPNOTSUPP are the same, so now we handle that
	case. [Bug: 1137]

	* library/init.tcl: Various small changes requested by Jan Nijtmans.
	- If the variable $tcl_library contains the empty string, this
	empty string will be put in $auto_path. This is not useful at all,
	it only slows down later package processing.
	- If the variable tcl_pkgPath is not set, the "unset __dir"
	fails. Thich makes init.tcl totally unusable. Better put a "catch"
	around it. 
	- In the function tcl_findLibraries, the "string match" function
	only works correctly if $tcl_patchLevel is in one of the forms
	"?.?a?", "?.?b?" or "?.?.?". Could a "regexp" be used instead,
	then it allows anything to be appended to the patchLevel
	string. And it is more efficient.
	- The tclPkgSetup function assumes that if $type != "load" then
	the type must be "source". This needn't be true. Some users want
	to add their own setup types.
	[RFE: 1138] [Bug: 978]

	* win/tclWinReg.c: 
	* doc/registry.n: Added support for HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA and
	HKEY_DYN_DATA keys. [Bug: 1109]

	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclPlatformInit): Added code to ensure
	tcl_pkgPath is set to "" when no registry entry is found. [Bug: 978]

1999-02-01    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclHistory.c:
	* generic/tclIO.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclInterp.c:
	* generic/tclMain.c:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclParse.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* generic/tclTimer.c:
	* generic/tcl.h: Made eval interfaces compatible with 8.0 by
	renaming Tcl_EvalObj to Tcl_EvalObjEx, renaming Tcl_Eval2 to
	Tcl_EvalEx and restoring Tcl_EvalObj and Tcl_GlobalEvalObj
	interfaces so they match Tcl 8.0.

1999-01-28    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Merged Tcl 8.0.5b1 changes.
	
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_DStringSetLength): Changed so the buffer
	overallocates in a manner similar to Tcl_DStringAppend.  This
	should improve performance for TclUniCharToUtfDString.

1998-12-11    === Tcl 8.1b1 Release ===
	
1998-12-10    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* Fixed lots of files that used TCL_THREAD instead of TCL_THREADS.
	
	* generic/tclEncoding.c (Tcl_FreeEncoding): Moved most of the code
	into a static FreeEncoding routine that does not grab the
	encodingMutex to avoid deadlocks/races when called from other
	routines that already have the mutex.

1998-12-09    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/msgcat1.0/msgcat.tcl: Fixed bad export list, fixed so
	all locale strings are converted to lower case, including file
	names.

	* generic/regcomp.c (makescan): Fixed bug in longest match case
	that caused anchored patterns to fail. [Bug: 897]

1998-12-08    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/msgcat1.0/msgcat.tcl: changed mc to invoke mcunknown in
	the calling context, changed locale lookups to be case insensitive

1998-12-07    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tclAlloc.c (TclpRealloc): Fixed a memory allocation bug
	where big blocks that were reallocated into a different heap
	location were not being placed into the bigBlocks list. [Bug: 933]

	* tests/msgcat.test: Added message catalog test suite.

	* library/msgcat1.0/msgcat.tcl: minor bug fixes, integrated latest
	changes from Mark Harrison.

1998-12-04    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* library/msgcat1.0/msgcat.tcl: Changed code to conform to Tcl
	coding standards.  Changed to use file join for portability.

	* library/msgcat1.0: Added initial implementaion of Tcl message
	catalog package contributed by Mark Harrison.

1998-12-03    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Fixed bug that kept
	arguments containing spaces from being properly quoted.

	* tests/defs: Changed so auto_path is set to only contain the Tcl
	library directory.  This keeps the tests from accidentally picking
	up stuff in installed packages. 

	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_StringMatch): Changed to match 8.0
	behavior in corner case where there is no closing bracket.

1998-12-02    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclpCreateCommandChannel): Changed
	reader/writer threads to have THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST so they will
	have a chance to run whenever there is something to do.

	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteBytes, WriteChars): Fixed so extraneous
	flushes do not happen in line mode.
	(TranslateOutputEOL): Made translation more efficient in line mode
	and fixed a buffer overflow bug in CRLF translation. [Bug: 887]

1998-12-02    <welch@SAGE>

	* Updated patchlevel to 8.1b1

1998-12-02    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/regc_color.c (subcolor): Added check for error case to
	avoid an out of bounds array reference.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_EncodingObjCmd): Changed to avoid using
	Tcl_DStringResult because it is not binary clean.

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_ParseCommand): Fixed bug in comment
	parsing where a trailing comment looked like an incomplete
	command. 

1998-12-02    <welch@SAGE>

	* Merged changes from 8.0.4, especially the new pkg_mkIndex

1998-12-01    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ReadChars): Added a call to UpdateInterest
	so we don't block when there is data sitting in the buffers.

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestevalobjvObjCmd): Updated for EvalObjv
	change.

	* tests/parse.test: Updated tests for EvalObjv change.

	* generic/tclParse.c (EvalObjv, Tcl_EvalObjv): Changed
	Tcl_EvalObjv interface to remove string and length arguments,
	preserved original interface as EvalObjv for internal use.

	* generic/tcl.h: Changed Tcl_EvalObjv interface to remove string
	and length arguments.

	* doc/Eval.3: Updated documentation for Tcl_EvalObjv to remove
	string and length arguments.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileForeachCmd): Fixed code that
	corrupted the exceptDepth value in the compile environment when
	foreach failed to compile inline. [Bug: 884]

	* library/encoding/euc-kr.enc: 
	* library/encoding/ksc5601.enc: 
	* tools/encoding/ksc5601.txt: 
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: Added support for Korean EUC. 

	* win/tclWinChan.c (TclpGetDefaultStdChannel): added check for a
	failure during Tcl_MakeFileChannel.

1998-11-30    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent): Fixed hang that occurs
	when trying to close a pipe that is currently being waited on by
	the notifier thread. [Bug: 607]

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (GetPermissionsAttribute): Increase size of
	returnString buffer to avoid overflow. [Bug: 584]

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (TclThreadSend): Fixed memory leak due
	to use of TCL_VOLATILE instead of TCL_DYNAMIC.

	* generic/tclThread.c (TclRememberSyncObject): Fixed memory leak
	caused by failure to reuse condition variables.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: 	(Tcl_AlertNotifier, Tcl_WaitForEvent,
	NotifierThreadProc, Tcl_InitNotifier): Fixed race condition caused
	by incorrect use of condition variables when sending messages
	between threads.. [Bug: 607]

	* generic/tclTestObj.c (TeststringobjCmd): MAX_STRINGS was off by one
	so the strings array was too small.

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c (Tcl_DbCkfree): Moved mutex lock so
	ValidateMemory is done inside the mutex to avoid a race condition
	when validate_memory is enabled. [Bug: 880]

1998-11-23    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* regexec.c: more performance tuning from Henry Spencer.

1998-11-17    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tclScan.c: moved "scan" implementation out of tclCmdMZ.c and
	added Unicode support.  This required a complete reimplementation
	of the command to avoid using scanf(), which isn't Unicode aware.
	Two new features were added in the process: %n to return the
	current number of characters consumed, and XPG3-style %n$ argument
	order specifiers similar to those provided by the "format"
	command. [Bug: 833]

	* tclAlloc.c: changed so allocated memory is always 8-byte aligned
	to improve memory performance and to ensure that it will work on
	systems that don't like accessing 4-byte aligned values
	(e.g. Solaris and HP-UX). [Bug: 834]

1998-11-06    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tclVar.c (TclGetIndexedScalar): Fixed bug 796, var name was
	getting lost before being passed to CallTraces.

1998-10-21    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* added "encoding" command
	
	* Moved internal regexp declarations from tclInt.h to tclRegexp.h

	* integrated regexp updates from Henry Spencer

1998-10-15    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* tclUtf.c: added Unicode character table support

	* tclInt.h: added TclUniCharIsWordChar

	* tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): added "totitle" subcommand,
	changed "wordend" and "wordstart" to properly handle Unicode word
	characters and connector punctuation

1998-10-05    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* auto.tcl, package.tcl: fixed SCCS strings

	* tclIndex: updated index to reflect 8.1 files

	* tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): changed to avoid modifying the
	input string in place because name lookup operations could have
	arbitrary side effects

	* tclInterp.c: added guard against deleting current interpreter

	* tclMacFile.c, tclUnixFile.c, tclWinFile.c, tclFileName.c: added
	warnings around code that modifies strings in place

	* tclExecute.c: fixed off-by-one copying error, fixed merge bugs

	* tclEvent.c: changed so USE_TCLALLOC is tested for value instead
	of definition

	* tclCompCmds.c: replaced SCCS strings, added warnings around code
	that modifies strings in place

	* interp.test: added test for interp deleting itself

1998-09-30    <stanton@GASPODE>

	* makefile.vc: fixed so TCL_LIBRARY is set before running tcltest

	* tclWin32Dll.c: removed TclpFinalize, cleanup of merges
