README -- Tcl test suite design document.

RCS: @(#) $Id: README,v 1.1.2.3 1999/03/23 20:06:07 hershey Exp $


Introduction:
-------------

This directory contains a set of validation tests for the Tcl commands
and C Library procedures for Tcl.  Each of the files whose name ends
in ".test" is intended to fully exercise the functions in the C source
file that corresponds to the file prefix.  The C functions and/or Tcl
commands tested by a given file are listed in the first line of the
file.

You can run the tests in three ways:

    (a) type "make test" in ../unix; this will run all of the tests.

    (b) type "tcltest <testFile> ?<option> <value>?
	Command line options include:

	-verbose <level>     set the level of verbosity to a substirng
			     of "bps"

	-match <matchList>   only run tests that match one or more of
			     the glob patterns in <matchList>

	-skip <skipList>     do not run tests that match one or more
			     of the glob patterns in <skipList>

	-file <globPattern>  only source test files that match
			     <globPattern> (relative to the "tests"
			     directory).  This option onloy applies
			     when you run the test suite with the
			     "all.tcl" file.

	-constraints <list>  tests with any of the following two
			     constraints:  knownBug and nonPortable
			     that appear in <list> should not be
			     skipped.

    (c) start up tcltest in this directory, then "source" the test
        file (for example, type "source parse.test").  To run all
	of the tests, type "source all.tcl".

In all cases, no output will be generated if all goes well, except for
a listing of the tests.  If there are errors then additional messages
will appear in the format described below.  Note that some tests will
be skipped if you run as superuser.

This approach to testing was designed and initially implemented by
Mary Ann May-Pumphrey of Sun Microsystems in the early 1990's.  Many
thanks to her for donating her work back to the public Tcl release.

The rest of this file provides additional information on the
features of the testing environment.


Definitions file:
-----------------

The file "defs.tcl" defines the "test" namespace which contains a
collection of procedures and variables used to run the tests.  It is
read in automatically by each of the .test files if needed, but once
it has been read once it will not be read again by the .test files.
Currently, the following procedures are exported from the "test"
namespace and automatically imported:

    test cleanupTests dotests saveState restoreState normalizeMsg
    makeFile removeFile makeDirectory removeDirectory viewFile
    safeFetch bytestring set_iso8859_1_locale restore_locale setTmpDir

Please refer to the defs.tcl file for documentation on these
procedures.

To keep tests from polluting the current working directory with
unwanted files, you can specify a temporary directory, which will
become the current working directory for the tests, by specifying
-tmpdir on the command line or by calling the ::tcltest::setTmpDir
procedure (after sourcing the defs.tcl file).  The default working dir
is the directory from which tcltest was called.  Please note that when
you run the test suite by calling "make test", the working dir is no
longer automatically switched to "tests".


Test output:
------------

For each test file, the number of tests passed, skipped, and failed is
printed to stdout.  Aside from this statistical information, output
can be controlled on a per-test basis by the ::tcltest::verbose variable.

::tcltest::verbose can be set to any substring or permutation of "bps".
In the string "bps", the 'b' stands for a test's "body", the 'p'
stands for "passed" tests, and the 's' stands for "skipped" tests.
The default value of ::tcltest::verbose is "b".  If 'b' is present, then
the entire body of the test is printed for each failed test, otherwise
only the test's name, desired output, and actual output, are printed
for each failed test.  If 'p' is present, then a line is printed for
each passed test, otherwise no line is printed for passed tests.  If
's' is present, then a line (containing the consraints that cause the
test to be skipped) is printed for each skipped test, otherwise no
line is printed for skipped tests.

You can set ::tcltest::verbose either interactively (after the defs.tcl
file has been sourced) or by the command line argument -verbose, for
example:

      tcltest socket.test -verbose bps


Selecting files to be sourced by all.tcl:
-----------------------------------------

You can specify the files you want all.tcl to source on the command
line with the -file options.  For example, if you call the
following:

     tcltest all.tcl -file "unix*.test"

all files in "tests" directory that match the pattern unix*.test will
be sourced by the all.tcl file.  Another useful example is if a
particular test hangs, say "get.test", and you just want to run the
remaining tests, then you can call the following:

     tcltest all.tcl -file "[h-z]*.test"

Note that the argument to -file will be substituted relative to the
"tests" directory.


Selecting tests for execution within a file:
--------------------------------------------

Normally, all the tests in a file are run whenever the file is
sourced.  An individual test will be skipped if one of the following
conditions is met:

    1) the "name" of the tests does not match (using glob style
       matching) one or more elements in the ::tcltest::matchingTests
       variable

    2) the "name" of the tests matches (using glob style matching) one
       or more elements in the ::tcltest::skippingTests variable

    3) the "constraints" argument to the "test" call, if given,
       contains one or more false elements.

You can set ::tcltest::matchingTests and/or ::tcltest::skippingTests either
interactively (after the defs.tcl file has been sourced), or by the
command line arguments -match and -skip, for example:

       tcltest socket.test -match "*2.* *4.*" -skip "*2.33*"

The two predefined constraints (knownBug and nonPortable) can be
overridden either interactively (after the defs.tcl file has been
sourced) by setting the ::tcltest::testConfig(<constraint>) variable, or
by using the -constraints command line option with the name of the
constraint in the argument.  The following example shows how to run
tests that are constrained by the knownBug and nonPortable
restricions:

	tcltest all.tcl -constraints "knownBug nonPortable"

See the defs.tcl file for information about each of these constraints.
Other constraints can be added at any time.  See the "Writing a new
test" section below for more details about using built-in constraints
and adding new ones.

Adding a New Test File:
-----------------------

If the file matches the tests/*.test pattern (as it should), then it
will automatically be run by the all.tcl file.  Make sure your test
file can be run from any working directory by running the following
from several different working directories:

	tcltest tests/all.tcl

Make sure no temporary files are left behind by your test file.  Your
test file should call "::tcltest::cleanupTests" before returning.  The
::tcltest::cleanupTests procedure prints statistics about the number of
tests that passed, skipped, and failed, and removes all files that
were created using the ::tcltest::makeFile and ::tcltest::makeDirectory
procedures.

Be sure your tests can run cross-platform in both the build
environment as well as the installation environment.  If your test
file contains tests that should not be run in or more of those cases,
please use the constraints mechanism described in the next section to
skip those tests.


Writing a new test:
-------------------

The following is the spec for the "test" command:

	test <name> <description> ?<constraint>? <script> <answer>

The <name> field should be:

	<target>-<majorNum>.<minorNum>

For white-box (regression) tests, the target should be the name of the
c function or Tcl procedure being tested.  For black-box tests, the
target should be the name of the feature being tested.  Related tests
should share a major number.

If your test requires that a file be created on the fly, please use
the ::tcltest::makeFile procedure.  If your test requires that a small
file (<50 lines) be checked in, please consider creating the file on
the fly using the ::tcltest::makeFile procedure.  Files created by the
::tcltest::makeFile procedure will automatically be removed by the
::tcltest::cleanupTests call at the end of each test file.

Add appropriate constraints (e.g., unixOnly) to any tests that should
not always be run.  For example, a test that should only be run on
Unix should look like the following:

    test getAttribute-1.1 {testing file permissions} {unixOnly} {
        lindex [file attributes foo.tcl] 5
    } {00644}

See the "Constraints" section for a list of built in
constraints and information on how to add your own constraints.


Constraints:
------------

Constraints are used to determine whether a test is run.  Each
constraint is stored as an index in the array ::tcltest::testConfig.  For
example, the unixOnly constraint is defined as the following:

    set ::tcltest::testConfig(unixOnly) \
	[expr {$tcl_platform(platform) == "unix"}]

If a test is constrained by "unixOnly", then it will only be run if
the value of ::tcltest::testConfig(unixOnly) is true.

The following is a list of constraints defined in the defs.tcl file:

unix            test can only be run on any UNIX platform
pc	        test can only be run on any Windows platform
nt	        test can only be run on any Windows NT platform
95	        test can only be run on any Windows 95 platform
mac	        test can only be run on any Mac platform
unixOrPc        test can only be run on a UNIX or PC platform
macOrPc	        test can only be run on a Mac or PC platform
macOrUnix       test can only be run on a Mac or UNIX platform
tempNotPc	test can not be run on Windows.  This flag is used
		to temporarily disable a test.
tempNotMac	test can not be run on a Mac.  This flag is used
		to temporarily disable a test.
unixCrash       test crashes if it's run on UNIX.  This flag is used
		to temporarily disable a test.
pcCrash 	test crashes if it's run on Windows.  This flag is
		used to temporarily disable a test.
macCrash 	test crashes if it's run on a Mac.  This flag is used
		to temporarily disable a test.

nonPortable	test can only be run in the master Tcl/Tk
		development environment.  Some tests are inherently
		non-portable because they depend on things like word
		length, file system configuration, window manager,
		etc.  These tests are only run in the main Tcl
		development directory where the configuration is
		well known.

interactive	test can only be run in if the interpreter is in
		interactive mode.


knownBug	test is known to fail and the bug is not yet
                fixed.  This constraint is always true.

emptyTest	test is empty, and so not worth running, but
                it remains as a place-holder for a test to be
                written in the future.  This constraint is always
                true.

nonBlockFiles	test can only be run if platform supports setting
		files into nonblocking mode

asyncPipeClose	test can only be run if platform supports async
		flush and async close on a pipe

unixExecs	test can only be run if this machine has commands
		such as 'cat', 'echo' etc available.

hasIsoLocale	test can only be run if can switch to an iso locale

fonts		test can only be run if the wish app's fonts can
		be controlled by Tk.

root		test can only run if Unix user is root
notRoot		test can only run if Unix user is not root

eformat		test can only run if app has a working version of
		sprintf with respect to the "e" format of
		floating-point numbers.

stdio		test can only be run if the current app can be
		spawned via a pipe

Saving keystrokes:
------------------

A convenience procedure named "::tcltest::dotests" is included in file
"defs.tcl".  It takes two arguments--the name of the test file (such
as "parse.test"), and a pattern selecting the tests you want to
execute.  It sets ::tcltest::matching to the second argument, calls
"source" on the file specified in the first argument, and restores
::tcltest::matching to its pre-call value at the end.


Incompatibilities with prior Tcl versions:
------------------------------------------

1) Global variables such as VERBOSE, TESTS, and testConfig are now
   renamed to use the new "test" namespace.

   old name   new name
   --------   --------
   VERBOSE    ::tcltest::verbose
   TESTS      ::tcltest::matchingTests
   testConfig ::tcltest::testConfig

   The introduction of the "test" namespace is a precursor to using a
   "test" package.  This next step will be part of a future Tcl
   version.

2) VERBOSE values are no longer numeric.  Please see the section above
   on "Test output" for the new usage of the ::tcltest::verbose variable.

3) When you run "make test", the working dir for the test suite is now
   the one from which you called "make test", rather than the "tests"
   directory.  This change allows for both unix and windows test
   suites to be run simultaneously without interference.  All tests
   must now run independently of their working directory.  You can
   also control the working directory from the tcltest command line
   with the -tmpdir option.
