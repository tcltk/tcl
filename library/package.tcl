# pkg_mkIndex --
# This procedure creates a package index in a given directory.  The
# package index consists of a "pkgIndex.tcl" file whose contents are
# a Tcl script that sets up package information with "package require"
# commands.  The commands describe all of the packages defined by the
# files given as arguments.
#
# Arguments:
# -direct		(optional) If this flag is present, the generated
#			code in pkgMkIndex.tcl will cause the package to be
#			loaded when "package require" is executed, rather
#			than lazily when the first reference to an exported
#			procedure in the package is made.
# -nopkgrequire		(optional) If this flag is present, "package require"
#			commands are ignored. This flag is useful in some
#			situations, for example when there is a circularity
#			in package requires (package a requires package b,
#			which in turns requires package a).
# -verbose		(optional) Verbose output; the name of each file that
#			was successfully rocessed is printed out. Additionally,
#			if processing of a file failed a message is printed
#			out; a file failure may not indicate that the indexing
#			has failed, since pkg_mkIndex stores the list of failed
#			files and tries again. The second time the processing
#			may succeed, for example if a required package has been
#			indexed by a previous pass.
# dir -			Name of the directory in which to create the index.
# args -		Any number of additional arguments, each giving
#			a glob pattern that matches the names of one or
#			more shared libraries or Tcl script files in
#			dir.

# the commands are used.
#
# Arguments:
# dir -			Directory containing all the files for this package.
# pkg -			Name of the package (no version number).
# version -		Version number for the package, such as 2.1.3.
# files -		List of files that constitute the package.  Each
#			element is a sub-list with three elements.  The first
#			is the name of a file relative to $dir, the second is
#			"load" or "source", indicating whether the file is a
#			loadable binary or a script to source, and the third
#			is a list of commands defined by this file.
